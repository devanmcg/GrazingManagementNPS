\lettrineabstract{This project contributes to an understanding of the current state of grassland resource management in five units of the National Park Service's Midwest Region.	
We focus on the grazing ecosystem, which \citet{frank1998} distinguish as a "prominent herbivore-based food web and by the extent to which ecological processes are regulated by dynamics within that food web."
Our primary finding is that sustainable management of grazing ecosystems in the NPS Midwest Region would benefit from integrated management of fire and grazing regimes.
