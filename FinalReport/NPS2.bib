  abstract = {Global biodiversity is threatened by invasive plant species. Without a thorough understanding of eﬀective management strategies, minimizing their impacts while improving native species diversity will be challenging. Burning in ﬁre-prone landscapes has been successful for managing invasive species and increasing native biodiversity, but it is unclear how speciﬁc ﬁre regimes improve restoration practices in novel ecosystems where invasive plants have a similar growth phenology to native plants. We investigated ﬁre as a restoration practice in the Northern Great Plains to decrease the cover of Kentucky bluegrass Poa pratensis (bluegrass), a perennial coolseason invasive grass phenologically similar to dominant native cool-season grasses, by 1) evaluating season of burn (early-growing season, late-growing season, and dormant season) in a ﬁeld experiment to test diﬀerences in plant community composition and 2) manipulating ﬁne fuels (3000–5000 kg ha−1) in an experimental approach to determine the eﬀects of ﬁre on plant survivability of selected native grasses and bluegrass. Bluegrass cover decreased 27\% on all ﬁeld burned plots the ﬁrst year post-ﬁre. Three years post-ﬁre, late-growing season and dormant season treatments had 35\% less bluegrass, whereas the early-growing season treatment was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the control. Overall, ﬁre altered the native plant community, with native plants more associated with burned plots. However, native plant community changes were only evident three years post-ﬁre in late-growing season and dormant season burn treatments. In the experimental approach, native grasses and bluegrass experienced high rates of mortality (40–50\%) at fuel loads above 4000 kg ha−1 and heat dosages above 30,000 °C·sec, features commonly associated with early-growing season burns. Therefore, early-growing season burns meant to reduce bluegrass may also impact native plants dominant in the region. Invasive species management is complicated in novel ecosystems when invasive plants have similar growth phenologies to native species. Control eﬀorts should consider how diﬀerent management strategies impact invasive and native plants alike. We found that late-growing season and dormant season burns, along with higher fuel loads, decreased bluegrass cover. Determining mechanisms of control in ﬁre-prone landscapes is a crucial step to improving invasive plant control and increasing native biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Woody encroachment is a widespread and acute phenomenon affectinggrasslands and savannas worldwide. We performed a meta-analysis of 29 studies from 13different grassland/savanna communities in North America to determine the consequences ofwoody encroachment on plant species richness. In all 13 communities, species richnessdeclined with woody plant encroachment (average decline¼45\%). Species richness declinedmore in communities with higher precipitation (r2¼0.81) and where encroachment wasassociated with a greater change in annual net primary productivity (ANPP;r2¼0.69). Basedon the strong positive correlation between precipitation and ANPP following encroachment(r2¼0.87), we hypothesize that these relationships occur because water-limited woody plantsexperience a greater physiological and demographic release as precipitation increases. Theobserved relationship between species richness and ANPP provides support for the theoreticalexpectation that a trade-off occurs between richness and productivity in herbaceouscommunities. We conclude that woody plant encroachment leads to significant declines inspecies richness in North American grassland/savanna communities.},

  abstract = {In the US Corn Belt, a recent doubling in commodity prices has created incentives for landowners to convert grassland to corn and soybean cropping. Here, we use land cover data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer to assess grassland conversion from 2006 to 2011 in the Western Corn Belt (WCB): five states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. Our analysis identifies areas with elevated rates of grass-to-corn/soy conversion (1.0–5.4\% annually). Across the WCB, we found a net decline in grass-dominated land cover totaling nearly 530,000 ha. With respect to agronomic attributes of lands undergoing grassland conversion, corn/soy production is expanding onto marginal lands characterized by high erosion risk and vulnerability to drought. Grassland conversion is also concentrated in close proximity to wetlands, posing a threat to waterfowl breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region. Longer-term land cover trends from North Dakota and Iowa indicate that recent grassland conversion represents a persistent shift in land use rather than short-term variability in crop rotation patterns. Our results show that the WCB is rapidly moving down a pathway of increased corn and soybean cultivation. As a result, the window of opportunity for realizing the benefits of a biofuel industry based on perennial bioenergy crops, rather than corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, may be closing in the WCB.},

  abstract = {In the Nebraska Sandhills, one of the largest contiguous grassland ecoregions remaining in North America, sandy textured soils are stabilized by ﬁne root biomass from predominantly warm-season grasses. Concerns over destabilization have led to management that aims to avoid an undesirable state change toward mobile sand dunes. In 2012, the Sandhills experienced extreme drought conditions that coincided with the worst wildﬁre year on state record. According to state-and-transition models and ecosystem managers, the combination of wildﬁre and drought conditions should cause a state transition due to a lack of recovery of grassland vegetation and a loss of sand dune stability. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a time-since-ﬁre study to track biomass recovery of Sandhills grassland vegetation following a wildﬁre on The Nature Conservancy’s Niobrara Valley Preserve in burned and unburned areas. Two yr following the wildﬁre, aboveground herbaceous biomass in burned areas had recovered to levels that did not differ from unburned areas, maintaining the stability of the sand dunes. This provides evidence that counters current land management frameworks that portray Sandhills grassland as highly vulnerable to destabilization when wildﬁres occur during severe drought conditions.},

  abstract = {Rangelands are ﬁre-dependent ecosystems severely altered through direct ﬁre suppression and fuels management. The removal of ﬁre is a dominant cause of ecological sites moving across thresholds with the majority of North American rangelands currently showing moderate or high departure from reference conditions. Recognizing the need to restore ﬁre on rangelands and incorporate prescribed ﬁre into management plans, the Natural Resource Conservation Service initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) to evaluate the validity current practices through peer-reviewed scientiﬁc literature. We updated the CEAP review and broadened the discussion of prescribed ﬁre as a global management practice. We reviewed and summarized prescribed ﬁre literature available through Web of Science using search terms in the title. The majority of literature (40\%) evaluated plant responses to ﬁre with ﬁre behavior and management (29\%), wildlife and arthropods (12\%), soils (11\%), and air quality (4\%) evaluated less frequently. Generally, ﬁre effects on plants are neutral to positive and the majority of negative responses lasted less than 2 years. Similarly, soil responses were recovered within 2 yr after burning. However, most studies did not report how long treatments were in place (62\%) or the size of experimental units (52\%). The experimental literature supporting prescribed burning is in need of greater managerial relevance that can be obtained by directly addressing spatial scale, temporal scale, and interaction with other disturbances, including drought and grazing. Reliance on information from single ﬁres applied on small plots tracked for a relatively short time interval greatly constrains inferences and application to ecosystem management and information should be applied with caution. Therefore, conservation purposes need to incorporate temporal dynamics to the extent that this information is available. The complex interaction of scientiﬁc knowledge, social concerns, and variable policies across regions are major limitations to the successful and critical restoration of ﬁre regimes.},

  abstract = {Prescribed burning in Theodore Roosevelt National Park has played an important role in maintaining a natural ecosystem. However, changes in plant community dynamics caused by burning may have led to an invasion of weedy species such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense L.). The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of a fall burn before spring herbicide application on Canada thistle control and to evaluate the soil seedbank within Canada thistle infestations. Canada thistle stem densities initially were higher in the burned compared with the nonburned areas because plants were slower to emerge in the nonburned treatments. However, the effect was short-lived, and Canada thistle densities were similar in the burned and nonburned treatments by the second season following the prescribed burn. Canada thistle control averaged 78\% 60 days after treatment with clopyralid, clopyralid plus triclopyr, or picloram when spring applied whether or not application was preceded by a prescribed burn. Control declined to less than 60\% by 363 days after application. Grass cover increased from an average of 5\% before treatment to 37\% and 46\% 60 and 425 days after herbicide application, respectively, regardless of burn treatment. Forb cover increased following a prescribed burn but was unaffected by herbicide treatment. Overall the number and variety of species in the soil seedbank was not affected by a prescribed burn. A total of 74 species (56 forbs, 13 grasses, and 5 other mesic species) were found in the soil seedbank. However, the majority of the soil seedbank consisted of nondesirable low seral and invasive species including Canada thistle and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which accounted for over 80\% of the total germinated seed. Although a prescribed burn caused an initial increase in Canada thistle density and cover, the greater long-term concern may be the lack of desirable species present in the seedbank to replace Canada thistle once the weed is controlled.
Resumen
La quema prescrita en el Parque Nacional Theodore Roosevelt ha jugado un papel importante en mantener un ecosistema natural. Sin embargo, cambios en las dinámicas de la comunidad vegetal causadas por las quemas puede conducir a una invasión de malezas, tal como el “Canada thistle” (Cirsium arvense L.). Los objetivos de esta investigación fueron evaluar el efecto de la quema en otoño antes de la aplicación de herbicidas en primavera para del “Canada thistle” y evaluar el banco de semillas del suelo en infestaciones del “Canada thistle.” Las densidades de tallos del “Canada thistle” inicialmente fueron mayores en las áreas quemadas que en las no quemadas porque las plantas fueron lentas en emerger en los tratamientos no quemados. Sin embargo, el efecto fue corto, y para la segunda estación de crecimiento después de la quema prescrita las densidades de “Canada thistle” fueron similares en los tratamientos quemados y no quemados. El control de “Canada thistle” promedio 78\% 60 días después de aplicar el tratamiento de clopiralid, clopiralid mas triclopir o picloram, esto cuando las aplicaciones fueron en primavera, sin importar si la aplicación fue precedida por fuego prescrito. 363 días después de la aplicación el control diminuyó a menos del 60\%. La cobertura de gramíneas se incrementó de 5\%, antes del tratamiento, a 37\% y 46\% 60 y 425 días después de la aplicación del herbicida respectivamente, independientemente del tratamiento de quema. La cobertura de hierbas se incrementó después del tratamiento de quema prescrita, pero no fue afectado por el tratamiento de herbicidas. En general, el número y variedad de especies en el banco de semillas del suelo no fue afectado por la quema prescrita. Un total de 74 especies (56 hierbas, 13 zacates y otras 5 especies mésicas) fueron encontradas en el banco de semillas del suelo. Pero, la mayoría del banco de semillas del suelo consistió de especies no deseables de etapa seral baja y especies invasoras, incluyendo “Canada thistle” y “Kentucky bluegrass” (Poa pratensis L.), las cuales aportaron más del 80\% del total de las semillas germinadas. Aunque un fuego prescrito causó un incremento inicial de la densidad y cobertura de “Canada thistle”, la preocupación a largo plazo puede ser la falta de especies deseables presentes en el banco de semillas para remplazar el “Canada thistle” una vez que la maleza ha sido controlada.},

To clarify this history, segments of 1-m cores from four lakes in North and South Dakota and northeastern Montana were examined for charcoal fragments.

Charcoal concentrations ranged from 6-14,799 fragments/gram of sediment, and mean charcoal abundance was negatively correlated with longitude. Results suggest periods of increased fire from A.D. 1700-1740 and A.D. 1850-1900. These peaks were broadly synchronous across the region and ranged in duration from 20-40 yr. Postsettlement patterns of charcoal deposition were highly variable but generally much lower than presettlement intervals.},

We evaluated aboveground biomass, cover, and frequency response to summer, fall, and spring ﬁres and no ﬁre on silty and clayey sites in semiarid, C3-dominated grassland. The magnitude of change in biomass between years was greater than any differences among ﬁre treatments. Still, differences existed among seasons of ﬁre. Summer ﬁre reduced non-native annual forb frequency (3\% vs. 10\% ± 2\%) and Hesperostipa comata, reduced native annual forbs the ﬁrst year, increased Poa secunda and bare ground, and increased Vulpia octoﬂora the second year. Fall ﬁre increased grass biomass (1224 vs. 1058 ± 56 kg∙ha−1), but fall ﬁre effects were generally similar to those of summer ﬁre. Spring ﬁre effects tended to be intermediate between no ﬁre and summer and fall ﬁre with the exception that spring ﬁre was most detrimental to H. comata the ﬁrst growing season and did not increase bare ground. All seasons of ﬁre reduced litter, forb biomass, and frequency of Bromus japonicus and Artemisia spp., and they reduced H. comata, V. octoﬂora, and native annual forbs the ﬁrst year, but increased basal cover of C3 perennial grasses (2.2\% vs. 0.6\% ± 0.4\%). Fire during any season increased dominance of native species compared with no ﬁre (6.6\% vs. 2.0\% ± 1.0\% basal cover) and maintained productivity. Seasonal timing of ﬁre manipulated species composition, but increased C3 perennial grass cover and native species dominance with ﬁre during any season indicated that using ﬁre was more important than the season in which it occurred. In addition, ﬁre effects on the vegetation components tended to be counter to previously observed effects of grazing, suggesting ﬁre and grazing may be complementary.},

  abstract = {Most wildﬁres occur during summer in the northern hemisphere, the area burned annually is increasing, and ﬁre effects during this season are least understood. Understanding plant response to grazing following summer ﬁre is required to reduce ecological and ﬁnancial risks associated with wildﬁre. Forty 0.75-ha plots were assigned to summer ﬁre then 0, 17, 34 or 50\% biomass removal by grazing the following growing season, or no ﬁre and no grazing. Root, litter, and aboveground biomass were measured before ﬁre, immediately after grazing, and 1 yr after grazing with the experiment repeated during 2 yr to evaluate weather effects. Fire years were followed by the second driest and ﬁfth wettest springs in 70 yr. Biomass was more responsive to weather than ﬁre and grazing, with a 452\% increase from a dry to wet year and 31\% reduction from a wet to average spring. Fire reduced litter 53\% and had no ﬁrst-year effect on productivity for any biomass component. Grazing after ﬁre reduced postgrazing grass biomass along the prescribed utilization gradient. Fire and grazing had no effect on total aboveground productivity the year after grazing compared to nonburned, nongrazed sites (1 327 vs. 1 249 6 65 kg Á haÀ1). Fire and grazing increased grass productivity 16\%, particularly for Pascopyrum smithii. The combined disturbances reduced forbs (51\%), annual grasses (49\%), and litter (46\%). Results indicate grazing with up to 50\% biomass removal the ﬁrst growing season after summer ﬁre was not detrimental to productivity of semiarid rangeland plant communities. Livestock exclusion the year after summer ﬁre did not increase productivity or shift species composition compared to grazed sites. Reduction of previous years’ standing dead material was the only indication that ﬁre may temporarily reduce forage availability. The consistent responses among dry, wet, and near-average years suggest plant response is species-speciﬁc rather than climatically controlled.},

Seeds of Japanese brome, spotted knapweed, Russian knapweed, and leafy spurge were subjected to fire at six fuel loads (100 to 700 g m22) and a nonburned control. Fires were simulated with field-cured grass and time–temperature profiles were developed from thermocouples at the soil surface. Emergence was determined by species and fuel load in growth chambers. Fuel load explained 98\% of variation in mean heat dosage and emergence decreased with increasing fuel load across species. Emergence was reduced 79 to 88\% relative to nonburned treatment with 100 g m22 of fuel and at least 97\% with 200 g m22 of fuel. Emergence probabilities were less than 0.01 for all species but spotted knapweed with a 300 g m22 fuel load. Results indicate high potential for fire to disrupt the life cycle of invasive species through direct seed mortality. The relationship between fuel load and seedling emergence provides good predictability of fire effects on surface-deposited seeds. A single fire is unlikely to eradicate many invasive species because they often produce abundant seeds and some will undoubtedly escape fire. However, abrupt reductions in seedling emergence with relatively light fuel loads indicate that fire may be an effective tool for increasing mortality of invasive plant seed across a broad range of habitats.

  abstract = {Exclusion of large grazers from rangelands that evolved with signiﬁcant grazing pressure can alter natural processes and may have legacy effects by changing magnitude or direction of community responses to subsequent disturbance. Three moderately grazed pastures were paired with 12-ha areas with 15 yr of livestock exclusion. Six treatments were assigned to each in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of ﬁre (fall ﬁre or no ﬁre) and grazing utilization (0\%, 50\%, or 75\% biomass removal) to determine grazing history effects on rangeland response to subsequent disturbance. Livestock exclusion increased C3 perennial grass (1 232 vs. 980 ± 50 kg ⋅ ha-1) and forbs (173 vs. 62 ± 19 kg ⋅ ha-1) and reduced C4 perennial grass (36 vs. 180 ± 25 kg ⋅ ha-1) with no effect on total currentyear biomass. Diversity was greater in pastures than exclosures (H’ = 1.5400 vs. 1.3823 ± 0.0431). Every biomass, cover, and diversity measure, except subshrub biomass, was affected by ﬁre, grazing utilization, or both. Contrary to expectations, grazing history only interacted with ﬁre effects for old standing dead material and interactions with grazing utilization were limited to old dead, bare ground, richness and dominance. Fire by grazing utilization interaction was limited to bare ground. Fire reduced annual grass (64 vs. 137 ± 29 kg ⋅ ha-1), forbs (84 vs. 133 ± 29 kg ⋅ ha-1), and diversity (H’ = 1.3260 vs. 1.5005 ± 0.0537) with no difference in total current-year biomass (1 557 vs. 1 594 ± 66 kg ⋅ ha-1). Grazing to 75\% utilization reduced total current-year biomass (1 467 vs. 1 656 ± 66 kg ⋅ ha-1) and dominance (0.4824 vs. 0.5584 ± 0.0279). Grazing history affected starting points for most variables, but changes caused by grazing utilization or ﬁre were similar between pastures and exclosures, indicating management decisions can be made based on independent knowledge of grazing or ﬁre effects.},

We selected 24, 4-ha plots near Woodward, OK. Four plots were burned during autumn (mid-November) and four during spring (mid-April), and four served as nonburned controls for each of two years. Cattle were given unrestricted access (April–September) to burned patches (Ͻ2\% of pastures) and utilization was about 78\%. Wind erosion, soil water content, and soil temperature were measured monthly. Wind erosion varied by burn, year, and sampling height. Wind erosion was about 2 to 48 times greater on autumn-burned plots than nonburned plots during the dormant period (December–April). Growing-season (April–August) erosion was greatest during spring. Erosion of spring-burned sites was double that of nonburned sites both years. Growing-season erosion from autumn-burned sites was similar to nonburned sites except for one year with a dry April–May. Soil water content was unaffected by patch burn treatments. Soils of burned plots were 1 to 3؇C warmer than those of nonburned plots, based on mid-day measurements. Lower water holding and deep percolation capacity of sandy soils probably moderated effects on soil water content and soil temperature. Despite poor growing conditions following fire and heavy selective grazing of burned patches, no blowouts or drifts were observed.},

  abstract = {Complete rest or grazing deferment is a general recommendation to encourage vegetative recovery following fire in the western United States. However, effects of grazing deferments on animal performance have not been determined. Prescribed fires were individually applied to nine separate, 1.5-ha pastures each year (2006 and 2007) for a total of 18 pastures. Grazing was deferred until spring (16 May), early summer (19 June), or late summer (1 August) the growing season after fire. At the end of each deferment, a 70-d (2007) or 41-d (2008) grazing period was initiated. Stocking rates were consistent between treatments within year, but were adjusted between years to achieve the targeted residual biomass of approximately 300 kg ? ha21. Diet quality was assessed approximately every 15 d throughout each grazing period (three pastures ? period21) via collection of rumen extrusa throughout the 2-yr study. Ewe body weight was measured on and off-test for each grazing period. Diet extrusa samples for in vitro organic matter disappearance was less (P 5 0.03) for late summer than early summer grazing periods and equal to the spring period (62.9, 64.6, and 61.0 6 0.90\%, respectively for spring, early summer, and late summer grazing periods). In vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance decreased (P 5 0.01) by 10.6 percentage units from early grazing to late grazing period in 2007, whereas no differences were observed in 2008. Ewe average daily gain did not differ between spring and early summer grazing periods and were greater (P 5 0.03) than the negligible body weight gains of the late summer grazing period. Total gain was 10.9 kg ? ha21 greater in 2008, and a quadratic response was measured for grazing period in 2007. Results indicate that deferment until early summer may be preferable so that stocking rates can be more accurately determined and animal performance is not diminished.},

Fencing is an integral part of rangeland infrastructure and receives much attention when there is a wildfire or even discussion about conducting prescribed fires. Due to known fence age and fire history, we conducted a study on the Oklahoma State University Research Range located near Stillwater, Oklahoma. Five randomly selected individual metal T posts were sampled from a common fence line of known age and fire treatment. The T posts ranged from 4 to 35 yr since fence construction, with fire activity of 0, 1, 3, or 12 prescribed fires and 0, 1, or 2 wildfire occurrences. Each T post was tested in situ at 40 cm, 80 cm, and 120 cm above ground level for hardness and paint adhesion as set forth by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standards for hot wrought metal fence posts. Our results found no differences in post hardness, with all posts tested being higher than the ASTM minimum standard of 83 Rockwell B Hardness Scale. We also found that paint adhesion between burned and unburned T posts did not vary, with age of post being the only significant predictor variable for adhesion. Overall, our results provide evidence that T posts exposed to numerous fires and fire types did not suffer negative effects. This shows that concerns about wildfire and prescribed fires in grasslands having negative effects on metal T posts are unfounded.},

  abstract = {Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) is an invasive, non-native plant in many terrestrial systems, often dominating plant communities, particularly in agricultural systems. Its invasion into forest systems is not well understood. Our objectives were to investigate the establishment, persistence, and abundance of C. arvense over a 7-year period following wildfire in a forest system, and to understand environmental factors related to variability in plant community composition. In 2006, we resurveyed 30 sites in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.) stands that burned during 1988 in Yellowstone National Park, and that had been previously sampled in 1999. C. arvense disappeared from six of nine sites where it was present in 1999, persisting in the remaining three sites; it also established at 4 new sites since 1999. Notably, the relative cover of C. arvense and other non-native plant species decreased during the 7-year period. Important ecosystem measures (plant species diversity and richness, aboveground net primary productivity, and leaf area index) were all higher in sites where C. arvense was present, and its abundance was higher on more fertile substrates and at lower elevations. Plant community composition was strongly influenced by gradients of soil texture and bare ground, rather than the presence or absence of non-native plant species. This project demonstrates the dynamic nature of an invasive species 18~years following a major disturbance, and suggests that intensive management of this species in forested systems is probably unnecessary.},

  abstract = {Global climate change is expected to alter carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and water availability, with uncertain impacts on agriculture. Forage quality and quantity in grazing systems are of particular concern because C3 and C4 plants respond differently to altered environmental conditions. In a growth chamber, we compared crude protein content, biomass recovery and total crude protein across a set of perennial C3 and C4 grasses from the northern U.S. Great Plains under elevated [CO2] and simulated drought. Simulated 95\% confidence intervals indicate both C3 and C4 grasses increased forage quality and quantity under elevated [CO2]. C4 grasses were generally resistant to water limitation while forage quality and quantity of C3 grasses declined under simulated drought. Our results are consistent with literature on forage quantity responses to elevated [CO2] and drought, but forage quality responses contradict expectations. We suggest measuring plant functional traits might better elucidate response mechanisms and ameliorate methodological differences even if traits are not directly applicable to grazing management.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is an important management practice used to control woody encroachment and invasive species in grasslands. To use this practice successfully, managers must understand the seasonal windows within which prescribed fire can be applied and how fire behavior could potentially vary among these windows. To characterize prescribed fire windows within the northern Great Plains of North America, we collected data from 20 remote weather stations positioned across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, USA, from station inception to 2015. We performed an hourly analysis for each station to determine if air temperature (2 to 43 °C), relative humidity (25 to 80\%), and wind speed (6.44 to 24.12 km h−\,1) conditions were within acceptable ranges for at least six contiguous precipitation-free hours from 0800 to 1800 h. We summarized acceptable conditions over five half-season windows and then used the Rothermel fire spread equation to simulate fire behavior within these half-season windows based on average, minimum, and maximum conditions for seasonally appropriate live herbaceous to fine dead fuel ratios.},
