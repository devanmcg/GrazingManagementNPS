  Abstract                 = {The Great Plains of North America evolved with significant influence from bison (Bison bison), but is presently dominated by cattle (Bos taurus). While there are a variety of opinions concerning differences between these two species, there is a lack of scientific comparisons, including those that incorporate important ecological variation. We developed a framework to study and compare the grazing behavior and effects of bison and cattle within grassland ecosystems. Environmental (e.g., resource distribution, disturbance) and animal (e.g., number, social organization) factors play a critical role in determining grazing effects and should be incorporated into discussions that compare the effects of bison and cattle. Using this framework we specifically compare the grazing behavior of both species in tallgrass prairie and discuss the implications of these differences in the context of conservation. We collared bison and cattle with global positioning systems and used resource selection functions to estimate the importance of various environmental factors on site selection. Both species preferred recently burned areas and avoided steeper slopes. Cattle selected areas that were closer to water, while bison were not limited by distance to water; cattle also preferred areas with woody vegetation, while bison avoided them. Incorporating broad scale environmental complexity allows for an effective comparison of ecological differences between bison and cattle. While there are similarities and differences in these species, a comprehensive analysis of all conditions and scenarios is not possible. It is clear, however, that the greatest differences between these species will likely be evident from broad scale studies across complex landscapes. In addition to species, conservation and land managers need to consider other environmental factors that are critical to grazing effects and overall conservation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Two Eurasian invasive annual brome grasses, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), are well known for their impact in steppe ecosystems of the western United States where these grasses have altered fire regimes, reduced native plant diversity and abundance, and degraded wildlife habitat. Annual bromes are also abundant in the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), but their impact and ecology are not as well studied. It is unclear whether the lessons learned from the steppe will translate to the mixed?grass prairie where native plant species are adapted to frequent fires and grazing. Developing a successful annual brome management strategy for National Park Service units and other NGP grasslands requires better understanding of (1) the impact of annual bromes on grassland condition; (2) the dynamics of these species through space and time; and (3) the relative importance of environmental factors within and outside managers' control for these spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we use vegetation monitoring data collected from 1998 to 2015 in 295 sites to relate spatiotemporal variability of annual brome grasses to grassland composition, weather, physical environmental characteristics, and ecological processes (grazing and fire). Concern about the impact of these species in NGP grasslands is warranted, as we found a decline in native species richness with increasing annual brome cover. Annual brome cover generally increased over the time of monitoring but also displayed a 3? to 5?yr cycle of reduction and resurgence. Relative cover of annual bromes in the monitored areas was best predicted by park unit, weather, extant plant community, slope grade, soil composition, and fire history. We found no evidence that grazing reduced annual brome cover, but this may be due to the relatively low grazing pressure in our study. By understanding the consequences and patterns of annual brome invasion, we will be better able to preserve and restore these grassland landscapes for future generations.},

  Abstract                 = {Current United States National Park Service (NPS) management is challenged to balance visitor use with the environmental and social consequences of automobile use. Wildlife populations in national parks are increasingly vulnerable to road impacts. Other than isolated reports on the incidence of road-related mortality, there is little knowledge of how roads might affect wildlife populations throughout the national park system. Researchers at the Western Transportation Institute synthesized information obtained from a system-wide survey of resource managers to assess the magnitude of their concerns on the impacts of roads on park wildlife. The results characterize current conditions and help identify wildlife-transportation conflicts. A total of 196 national park management units (NPS units) were contacted and 106 responded to our questionnaire. Park resource managers responded that over half of the NPS unitsâ€™ existing transportation systems were at or above capacity, with traffic volumes currently high or very high in one quarter of them and traffic expected to increase in the majority of units. Data is not generally collected systematically on road-related mortality to wildlife, yet nearly half of the respondents believed road-caused mortality significantly affected wildlife populations. Over one-half believed habitat fragmentation was affecting wildlife populations. Despite these expressed concerns, only 36\% of the NPS units used some form of mitigation method to reduce road impacts on wildlife. Nearly half of the respondents expect that these impacts would only worsen in the next five years. Our results underscore the importance for a more systematic approach to address wildlife-roadway conflicts for a situation that is expected to increase in the next five to ten years.},

  Abstract                 = {Leafy spurge is a troublesome weed on the northern Great Plains of the United States that chemicals and grazing management have not controlled. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technology have been used to detect and monitor numerous grassland related problems. The objectives of this study were to use both technologies to map and quantify the extent of leafy spurge within Theodore Roosevelt National Park and to provide information for managing the infestation. Analysis of the data indicated that 702 ha of the 18,680 ha park were infested by leafy spurge; however, leafy spurge populations occurring under dense woody canopies, in deep stream channels, and on steep slopes were not always detected. Infestations were especially dense in the western and southeast portions of the park. Most infestations were restricted to riparian zones and smaller drainage channels. Leafy spurge infestations decreased exponentially as distance from stream channels increased (r2=0.98). The significant association of leafy spurge with drainage channels suggests that the weed might be effectively managed on a watershed subâ€�basin level. The joint use of GIS and remote sensing proved to be a powerful combination of tools which provided previously unavailable information about the extent and spatial dynamics of leafy spurge within the park. The results of this study will contribute to the development of a comprehensive leafy spurge management plan for Theodore Roosevelt National Park (South Unit).},

  Abstract                 = {Cumulative pressures from global climate and ocean change combined with multiple regional and local-scale stressors pose fundamental challenges to coral reef managers worldwide. Understanding how cumulative stressors affect coral reef vulnerability is critical for successful reef conservation now and in the future. In this review, we present the case that strategically managing for increased ecological resilience (capacity for stress resistance and recovery) can reduce coral reef vulnerability (risk of net decline) up to a point. Specifically, we propose an operational framework for identifying effective management levers to enhance resilience and support management decisions that reduce reef vulnerability. Building on a system understanding of biological and ecological processes that drive resilience of coral reefs in different environmental and socio-economic settings, we present an Adaptive Resilience-Based management (ARBM) framework and suggest a set of guidelines for how and where resilience can be enhanced via management interventions. We argue that press-type stressors (pollution, sedimentation, overfishing, ocean warming and acidification) are key threats to coral reef resilience by affecting processes underpinning resistance and recovery, while pulse-type (acute) stressors (e.g. storms, bleaching events, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) increase the demand for resilience. We apply the framework to a set of example problems for Caribbean and Indo-Pacific reefs. A combined strategy of active risk reduction and resilience support is needed, informed by key management objectives, knowledge of reef ecosystem processes and consideration of environmental and social drivers. As climate change and ocean acidification erode the resilience and increase the vulnerability of coral reefs globally, successful adaptive management of coral reefs will become increasingly difficult. Given limited resources, on-the-ground solutions are likely to focus increasingly on actions that support resilience at finer spatial scales, and that are tightly linked to ecosystem goods and services.},

  Abstract                 = {In the Nebraska Sandhills, one of the largest contiguous grassland ecoregions remaining in North America, sandy textured soils are stabilized by ï¬�ne root biomass from predominantly warm-season grasses. Concerns over destabilization have led to management that aims to avoid an undesirable state change toward mobile sand dunes. In 2012, the Sandhills experienced extreme drought conditions that coincided with the worst wildï¬�re year on state record. According to state-and-transition models and ecosystem managers, the combination of wildï¬�re and drought conditions should cause a state transition due to a lack of recovery of grassland vegetation and a loss of sand dune stability. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a time-since-ï¬�re study to track biomass recovery of Sandhills grassland vegetation following a wildï¬�re on The Nature Conservancyâ€™s Niobrara Valley Preserve in burned and unburned areas. Two yr following the wildï¬�re, aboveground herbaceous biomass in burned areas had recovered to levels that did not differ from unburned areas, maintaining the stability of the sand dunes. This provides evidence that counters current land management frameworks that portray Sandhills grassland as highly vulnerable to destabilization when wildï¬�res occur during severe drought conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Projected changes in global climate have important ramifications for the future of national parks and other reserves set aside to conserve ecological uniqueness. We explored potential implications of climatic changes on lifeform distribution and growth at Wind Cave National Park (WCNP), South Dakota, which lies on a climatically determined ecotone between grassland and forest. Fire, promoted by healthy grasslands, is a negative feedback limiting tree development because it kills seedlings and consumes live foliage thus reducing tree growth and survival. Historical records show that fire suppression has enhanced forest expansion. On the other hand, livestock grazing reduces grass biomass and fuel loads thus indirectly reducing fire frequency and enhancing the expansion of forests or woodlands. Natural fires and moderate grazing by native herbivores have maintained the coexistence of trees and grasses but climatic variations affecting the area's water resources can lead to dominance by either lifeform. We used a dynamic vegetation model (DVM) MC1 to simulate the interactions between climatic changes, natural fire regime, and grazing pressure and their impact on the biogeographical and biogeochemical characteristics of the park. We used one future climate projection (HADCM2SUL) which simulates warmer weather by the end of the next century: the temperature increase would constrain the growth of trees that rely on the availability of deep water, favor shrub and grass development and promote a shift from forests to woodlands. Woody encroachment of shrubs in grasslands areas, enhanced by grazing, was only held in check by frequent natural fires in the simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Little work has focused on species presence, distributions, and habitat use of bats in the Great Plains of North America. In particular, no previous study has attempted to determine if bats are utilizing hibernacula during the winter months in North Dakota. The current lack of information regarding bat species presence during the winter months in North Dakota can have great conservation implications. Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungal pathogen responsible for white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats across the United States and Canada, has led to great concern for wildlife managers. For many of the areas where WNS is present, information about the presence and location of hibernacula are known, allowing for close monitoring of the spread of the disease. However, some locations within the predicted path of WNS still lack information as to bat species presence during the winter months. Due to mortality rates sometimes reaching upwards of 100\% as a result of WNS infection, filling in these information gaps is critical for conservation research. The purpose of this study was to determine if the badlands region of North Dakota supports over-wintering bat communities, document both utilized and potential hibernacula, and develop a Geographic Information Systems model in the program MaxEnt to be used for future studies and wildlife managers. Six species were positively identified in the badlands region of North Dakota during the pre-hibernation and winter hibernation periods: Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus), Silver-haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans), Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus), Long-eared Myotis (Myotis evotis), Townsend's Big-eared Bat (Corynorhinus townsendii), and Western Small-footed Myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum). Habitat suitability modeling was employed to model potential hibernacula in the study area. Knowledge of these potential hibernacula could be of great importance to wildlife managers, and results from this study may be used by regional wildlife managers to develop strategies for curtailing the spread of this disease into North Dakota.},

We present a quantitative classiï¬�cation of the climate space that is independent from the geographic locations to evaluate the climatic representation of the existing protected area network. We use this classiï¬�cation to evaluate the coverage of each agencyâ€™s jurisdiction and to identify current conservation deï¬�cits. Our ï¬�ndings reveal that the existing network poorly represents CONUS climatic diversity. Although rare climates are generally well represented by the network, the most common climates are particularly underrepresented. Overall, 83\% of the area of the CONUS corresponds to climates underrepresented by the network. The addition of some currently unprotected federal lands to the network would enhance the coverage of CONUS climates. However, to fully palliate current conservation deï¬�cits, large-scale private-land conservation initiatives will be critical.},

Case studies reported here illustrate the importance of human dimensions research. Incorporating such research into the scientific agenda â€“ as well as into management decisions of public agencies concerned with natural resource management, environmental protection, and public health and welfare â€“ requires the development of both strategic guidance and institutional capacity.

  Abstract                 = {.   Feral horses are widespread in the western United States, with the majority of feral horse herds found in the Great Basin. There is a federal mandate to manage these herds in order to maintain â€œecological balanceâ€�; however, understanding of the specific effects of feral horse grazing on rangeland plant communities in this region is incomplete. To address this research gap, we utilized long-term grazing exclosures and fenceline contrasts to evaluate the impacts of feral horses on several plant community variables (diversity, richness, dominance, and biomass) and species composition. Because the effects of grazing can vary with site precipitation and productivity, we selected 5 sites from 4 different rangeland types (Great Basin Desert, Colorado Plateau, Rocky Mountain grassland, and mixed grass prairie) that spanned a mean annual precipitation gradient of 229 to 413 mm. Our results did not reveal a significant effect of feral horse grazing on plant community composition, species richness, diversity, evenness, or dominance. In contrast, total aboveground herbaceous biomass and grass biomass were significantly reduced with feral horse grazing, but these effects did not vary with mean annual precipitation. Our results suggest that, at least at the sites we studied, feral horses have affected the plant community by reducing herbaceous biomass but have not caused plant community shifts. Additional multisite studies, preferably with standardized exclosures and larger sample sizes, would increase our understanding of feral horse grazing effects and inform management of feral horse herds in the western United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent opposition to the rangeland management paradigm of achieving uniform, moderate grazing across entire landscapes has emerged because heterogeneity is recognized as the foundation of biodiversity, ecosystem resilience, and multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. Agriculture production goals appear to drive the traditional rangeland management focus on homogeneity and uniformity. To determine if preference for homogeneity is a broadly applicable social construct or one limited to agricultural producers, we determined preferences for heterogeneous grassland landscapes expressed by three study populationsâ€”managers of working lands (ranchers), natural resource professionals (grassland/rangeland specialists), and the general population living in rangeland regions within the US Great Plains. We distributed surveys that included photographs of landscapes and patterned images to assess preference. Preference for heterogeneous landscapes among ranchers, natural resource professionals, and the general population in our study area were generally consistent with the central paradigm of managing rangeland for homogeneity. However, we discovered that people, across geographic location and population group, clearly prefer heterogeneous patterned images to homogeneous patterned images. This suggests that preference for homogeneity is acquired.},

  Abstract                 = {The Great Plains of the United States is a grassland region managed primarily for homogeneity associated with production agriculture. The resulting decline of obligate fauna makes enhancing biodiversity an increasingly important ecological goal. A survey was administered to land managers and the general population in ranching regions of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Texas Panhandle. This research explores the preferred characteristics of privately owned grasslands among ranchers and the general population for vegetation structure and biodiversity. Results indicate a knowledge gap between biodiversity and the vegetation heterogeneity required to support it. Preference for grassland structure is seen as a sociocultural driver of decisions on management practices that constrain adoption of heterogeneity management. Conserving biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem services provided by heterogeneous grasslands can be accomplished by demonstrating that conservation advantages of heterogeneity and production agriculture are compatible.

  Abstract                 = {As the US National Park Service marks its centennial in 2016, parks and protected areas worldwide are under increasing threat from a variety of factors, including storms and fires of greater severity, plant and animal extinctions, the changing attitudes of a public that has become more urbanized, and the political pressures of narrow special interest groups. In the face of such rapid environmental and cultural changes, Science, Conservation, and National Parks gathers a group of renowned scholarsâ€”including Edward O. Wilson, Jane Lubchenco, Thomas Dietz, and Monica Turner, among many othersâ€”who seek to address these problems and, in so doing, to secure a future for protected areas that will push forward the frontiers of biological, physical, and social science in and for parks.  Examining the major challenges of parks and protected areas throughout the world, contributors provide answers to a number of key conservation questions, such as: How should stewardship address climate change, urban encroachment and pollution, and invasive species? How can society, especially youth, become more engaged with nature and parks, and are there models to guide interactions between parks and their neighbors? What are appropriate conservation objectives for parks in the Anthropocene? Charting a course for the parks of the next century, Science, Conservation, and National Parks is certain not only to catalyze the continued evolution of US park conservation policy, but also to be an inspiration for parks, conservation, and management worldwide.},

Mercury and cadmium decreased approximately 30\% over the time period in both species. Sulfur decreased 8\% in the epiphytic species, but increased 20\% in the soil lichen. Factor analysis revealed that soil elements were higher in the soil lichen, indicating there was some soil contamination in that species. A relationship between iron and titanium was found only in the soil lichen. Sulfur and mercury were highly enriched in both species relative to the soil, which suggests that the atmosphere is a contributing source of these elements. New baseline values were calculated, 22 elements for both species, although it is not recommended that the soil lichen be sampled in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {The social and ecological contexts for rangeland management are changing rapidly, prompting a reevaluation of science, management, and their relationship. We argue that progression from steady-state management to ecosystem management has served the rangeland profession well, but that further development toward resilience-based management is required to ensure that ecosystem services are sustained in an era of rapid change. Resilience-based management embraces the inevitability of change and emphasizes that management should seek to guide change to benefit society. The objectives of this forum are to: 1) justify the need for adopting resilience-based management, 2) identify the challenges that will be encountered in its development and implementation, and 3) highlight approaches to overcoming these challenges. Five grand challenges confronting the adoption of resilience-based management, based upon the insights of 56 rangeland researchers who have contributed to this special issue, were identified as: 1) development of knowledge systems to support resilience-based management, 2) improvement of ecological models supporting science and management, 3) protocols to assess and manage tradeoffs among ecosystem services, 4) use of social-ecological system models to integrate diverse knowledge sources, and 5) reorganization of institutions to support resilience-based management. Resolving the challenges presented here will require the creation of stronger partnerships between ecosystem managers, science organizations, management agencies, and policymakers at local, regional, and national scales. A realistic near-term goal for achieving such partnerships is to initiate and support collaborative landscape projects. The creation of multiscaled social learning institutions linked to evolving knowledge systems may be the best approach to guide adaptation and transformation in rangelands in the coming century.},

In this chapter, we summarize the invasion potential, ecosystem threats, and management strategies for different Bromus species within each of five ecoregions of the western United States. We characterize invasion potential and threats in terms of ecosystem resistance to Bromus invasion and ecosystem resilience to disturbance with an emphasis on the importance of fire regimes. We also explain how soil temperature and moisture regimes can be linked to patterns of resistance and resilience and provide a conceptual framework that can be used to evaluate the relative potential for invasion and ecological impact of the dominant exotic annual Bromus species in the western United States.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecotones are boundaries between plant assemblages that can represent a physiological or competitive limit of speciesâ€™ local distributions, usually through one or more biotic or abiotic constraints on speciesâ€™ resource requirements. However, ecotones also result from the effects of chronic or episodic disturbances, and changes in disturbance regimes may have profound effects on vegetation patterns in transitional areas. In this study, centuries-long chronologies of surface fire events were reconstructed from fire-scarred ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) trees in three sites at the ecotone between ponderosa pine forest and Northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie in the southeastern Black Hills of South Dakota. The fire chronologies provide baseline data to assess the possible role of fire in this transitional area and to document historical variability in fire regimes in this region of the Northern Great Plains. Regular fire events were recorded at all three sites from the beginning of the fire chronologies in the 1500s up to the late 1800s or early 1900s, at which time spreading fires ceased. Fire frequencies derived from the fire chronologies were compared to each other and to four sites from interior ponderosa pine forest in the south-central Black Hills. Mean fire intervals at the savanna sites were between 10 to 12 years, whereas Weibull median probability intervals were one year shorter. Fire frequency at the savanna sites was twice as high as at the interior forest sites, and most likely was due to spatial extent of fires on the mixed-grass prairie coupled with warmer and drier climate regime. Post-settlement shifts in the ponderosa pine savanna during the twentieth century in this area may be largely attributed to lack of fire occurrences, although grazing and other factors also likely contributed to observed changes in forest and grassland margins.},

In practice, however, considerable challenges to integrating the social and natural sciences remain. In this article, we review the US Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) 2009 decision to remove the northern Rocky Mountain population of gray wolves from the federal list of endangered species. We examine the FWS's arguments concerning the threat posed by humans' attitudes toward wolves in light of the existing social science literature. Our analysis found support for only one of four arguments underlying the FWS's assessment of public attitudes as a potential threat to wolves. Although we found an extensive literature on attitudes toward wolves, the FWS cited just one empirical research article. We conclude that when listing decisions rest on assumptions about society, these assumptions should be evaluated using the best available natural and social science research.},

  Abstract                 = {In the United States and around the world, scientists and practitioners have debated the definition and merits of ecosystem management as a new approach to natural resource management. While these debates continue, a growing number of organizations formally have adopted ecosystem management. However, adoption does not necessarily lead to successful implementation, and theories are not always put into practice. In this article, we examine how a leading natural resource agency, the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, has translated ecosystem management theory into concrete policy objectives and how successfully these objectives are perceived to be implemented throughout the national forest system. Through document analysis, interviews, and survey responses from 345 Forest Service managers (district rangers, forest supervisors, and regional foresters), we find that the agency has incorporated numerous ecosystem management components into its objectives. Agency managers perceive that the greatest attainment of such objectives is related to collaborative stewardship and integration of scientific information, areas in which the organization has considerable prior experience. The objectives perceived to be least attained are adaptive management and integration of social and economic information, areas requiring substantial new resources and a knowledge base not traditionally emphasized by natural resource managers. Overall, success in implementing ecosystem management objectives is linked to committed forest managers.},

Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full socialâ€“ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex socialâ€“ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

In 2003 and 2004, we captured a total of 26 coyotes and radiocollared 22 adults (12 F, 10 M). In 2003 and 2004, 2 of 17 (12\%) and 5 of 9 (56\%) coyotes, respectively, were infected with sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) at the time of capture. Thus, objectives were modified to document effects of the mange epizootic on the coyote population. In 2003, home-range (adaptive-kernel) sizes for male coyotes with mange and those considered healthy were 8.26 Â± 1.63 (SE) km2 and 9.67 Â± 2.80 km2, respectively. In 2004, home-range sizes for those male coyotes with and without mange were 22.69 Â± 9.06 km2 and 12.51 Â± 2.73 km2, respectively. Male home-range size did not differ between years (P = 0.14) or by status (with or without mange; P = 0.84). Survival of collared coyotes was 60\% at the end of 2003. Results from fecal line transects, an index of relative abundance, indicated that the coyote population decreased by 48\% from 2003 to 2004. Continued monitoring of sarcoptic mange epizootics will enable managers to assess the effects of mange on coyote populations.},

Objectives included (1) determining whether bison selected for prairie dog towns parkwide; (2) characterizing in greater detail bison use patterns of a 36-ha colony in Pringle Valley as a function of time since prairie dog colonization; and (3) relating these bison use patterns to measured changes in structure and nutritional value of vegetation on and off the dog town. During midsummer, prairie dog towns were one of the most frequently used habitats by bison parkwide. Day-long observations at Pringle Valley revealed that bison exerted strong selection (nearly 90\% of all habitat use and feeding time) for the dog town, which occupied only 39\% of the valley. While there, they partitioned their use of the colony by grazing in moderately affected areas (occupied {$<$}8 years by prairie dogs) and by resting in the oldest area ({$>$}26 years occupation). Prairie dogs facilitate bison habitat selection for a short-grass successional stage in this mixed-grass community by causing a broad array of compositional, structural, and nutritional changes in the vegetation.},

The study was done on a northern mixed-grass prairie site at wind Cave National Park, South Dakota.Peak live plant biomass was greatest (190 g/m2) on the uncolonized part of the study area and least (95 g/m2) on a part of the prairie dog town colonized for 3 to 8 y. Peak live plant biomass (170 g/m2) of the oldest portion of the prairie dog town (colonized {$>$}26 y) was not significantly different from that of uncolonized prairie. However, where-as graminoids composed {$>$}85\% of the total biomass of the latter area, forbs and dwarf shrubs (Artemisia frigida) were {$>$}95\% of the total of the former. Both standing-dead plant biomass and litter declined markedly as time since colonization increased. Total plant species diversity (H) was greatest in the young prairie dog town (colonized for 3 to 8 y).Nitrogen concentration of plant shoots varied significantly as a function of time since colonization. Shoot-nitrogen was lowest in plants from the uncolonized site and greatest in plants collected from the longest-colonized areas of the prairie dog town. Shoot-nitrogen declined significantly over the growing season and tended to be higher in C3 graminoids than in C4 graminoids. In vitro digestible dry matter showed similar trends; the differences between C3 and C4 digestibilities were greatest during the last half of the growing season.We suggest that prairie dog-induced changes in plant biomass, plant species diversity, plant nutrient content, and forage digestibility may lead to further alterations of nutrient cycling and trophic dynamics in this mixed-grass prairie ecosystem.},

  Abstract                 = {In the United States, natural resources are held in trust for the American people and future generations. Because managers make decisions on behalf of the public, this necessitates an understanding of their preferences, values, and opinions towards the resources being held in trust for them; understanding stakeholder groups helps managers make better decisions on their behalf. This presentation addresses two conceptually related but diverse topics in the realm of natural resource management pertaining to (1) the Risk Information Seeking and Processing behaviors of northwest Minnesota deer hunters after bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) was detected in the local whitetail deer population, and (2) farmers' attitudes towards and motivations for participation in federal conservation programs beneficial to wildlife. The first of these projects found that attitudes exerted the greatest influence on hunters' information seeking behaviors towards bovine tuberculosis in a model that included individual characteristics, personal impacts, trust in the DNR, norms, and information sufficiency. The research on farmers' beliefs about enrollment in conversation programs suggested that a model including knowledge, community, and behavioral obligation dimensions drawn from Leopold's Land Ethic explained 54\% of the variance in farmers' perceived environmental responsibilities. Although these studies focus on unrelated topics, they concern the human dimensions of natural resource management, address current issues faced by managers and decision makers, and are theory directed research. Ultimately the information gained through these projects will aid in the development of outreach efforts and design of conservation programs, as well as contribute to cumulative knowledge to better understand social psychological theory applied to resource management.},

  Abstract                 = {The sustainable science-based management of natural resources requires knowledge exchange between scientists and environmental decision-makers; however, evidence suggests that information flow is inhibited by a range of barriers. To date, our understanding of the range and importance of factors limiting knowledge exchange between scientists and decision-makers is based primarily on the perceptions of decision-makers, while the perceptions of scientists have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively assessing the perceptions of scientists, represented by a sample of 78 Australian marine scientists, regarding (i) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers on a personal level, (ii) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers at the institutional level, (iii) current barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers and (iv) options for overcoming barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers. Survey results suggest that Australian marine scientists feel that they have an obligation to engage decision-makers in their science, and that engaging with and communicating to environmental decision-makers is important on a personal level. This study also identifies a range of barriers that impede engagement activities, including inadequate measures of science impact that do not account for engagement activities, a lack of organisational support for engagement activities, insufficient time to conduct engagement activities in addition to other responsibilities and a lack of funding to support engagement activities. To overcome these barriers, participants identified the need for institutional innovation by research institutions, research funders and decision-making agencies alike to promote a culture whereby knowledge exchange activities are legitimised as core business for research scientists, and recognised and rewarded appropriately. Although difficulties exist in implementing such institutional innovations, doing so will improve two-way knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers and improve the likely success of environmental management.},

  Abstract                 = {* A wide range of spatially explicit simulation models have been developed to forecast landscape dynamics, including models for projecting changes in both vegetation and land use. While these models have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate purpose and audience, they share many common features.

* We present a general framework, called a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM), which captures a number of these common features, accompanied by a software product, called ST-Sim, to build and run such models. The STSM method divides a landscape into a set of discrete spatial units and simulates the discrete state of each cell forward as a discrete-time-inhomogeneous stochastic process. The method differs from a spatially interacting Markov chain in several important ways, including the ability to add discrete counters such as age and time-since-transition as state variables, to specify one-step transition rates as either probabilities or target areas, and to represent multiple types of transitions between pairs of states.

* We demonstrate the STSM method using a model of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change for the state of Hawai'i, USA. Processes represented in this example include expansion/contraction of agricultural lands, urbanization, wildfire, shrub encroachment into grassland and harvest of tree plantations; the model also projects shifts in moisture zones due to climate change. Key model output includes projections of the future spatial and temporal distribution of LULC classes and moisture zones across the landscape over the next 50~years.

* State-and-transition simulation models can be applied to a wide range of landscapes, including questions of both land-use change and vegetation dynamics. Because the method is inherently stochastic, it is well suited for characterizing uncertainty in model projections. When combined with the ST-Sim software, STSMs offer a simple yet powerful means for developing a wide range of models of landscape dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional farming landscapes have evolved as tightly coupled socioecological systems that support high biodiversity. However, land-use change severely threatens the high biodiversity of these landscapes. Navigating nature conservation in such landscapes requires a thorough understanding of the key drivers underpinning biodiversity. Through empirical research on mammals, birds, butterflies, and plants in a traditional cultural landscape in Romania, we revealed seven hypothesized drivers facilitating biodiversity conservation. Similar proportions of three main land-use types support the landscape species pool, most likely through habitat connectivity and frequent spillover between land-use types. Landscape complementation and supplementation provide additional habitat for species outside their core habitats. Gradients of woody vegetation cover and gradients in land-cover heterogeneity provide mosaic landscapes with wide ranges of resources. Traditional land-use practices underpin landscape heterogeneity, traditional land-use elements such as wood pastures, and humanâ€“carnivore coexistence. Top-down predator control may limit herbivore populations. Lastly, cultural ties between humans and nature have a central influence on people's values and sustainable use of natural resources. Conservation approaches should aim to maintain or restore these socioecological drivers by targeting the heterogeneous character of the forestâ€“farmland mosaic at large scales through â€œbroad and shallowâ€� conservation measures. These large-scale measures should be complemented with â€œdeep and narrowâ€� conservation measures addressing specific land-use types, threats, or species. In both cases, conservation measures should integrate the entire socioecological system, by recognizing and strengthening important links between people and the environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In western North America, endangered black?footed ferrets Mustela nigripes are conserved via reintroduction to colonies of prairie dogs Cynomys spp., their primary prey. Predation is an important source of mortality; coyotes Canis latrans appear to be the most problematic predator, accounting for 67\% of known predation events on radio?tagged ferrets. Little is known about what factors affect spatial use of prairie dog colonies by coyotes, or how other animals might affect interactions between coyotes and ferrets. During June?October 2007?2008, we used spotlight surveys to monitor coyotes and ferrets (both years) and rabbits Sylvilagus spp. (first year) on a 452?ha colony of black?tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus in the Conata Basin, South Dakota. Coyotes appeared to select areas of the colony used by rabbits, suggesting coyotes hunted rabbits, a common item in their diet. Between midnight and sunrise, ferrets were most commonly observed during early morning (01:00?03:00?h), whereas coyotes were observed mostly during dawn (04:00?h ? sunrise) when ferrets were rarely seen. These temporal differences in the timing of observations suggest ferrets tend to remain underground in burrows when coyotes are most active. Coyotes appeared to be attracted to rabbits in both space and time, suggesting the risk of predation for ferrets might relate to the abundance and locations of rabbits in prairie dog colonies.},

Most of the ecosystem management literature assumes that scientific understanding of ecosystems is solely the purview of natural scientists. While the evolving principles of ecosystem management recognize that people play an important role, social considerations are usually limited to political and decision-making processes and to development of environmental education. This view is incomplete. The social science aspect of ecosystem management has two distinct components: one that concerns greater public involvement in the ecosystem management decision-making process, and one that concerns integrating social considerations into the science of understanding ecosystems. Ecosystem management decisions based primarily on biophysical factors can polarize people, making policy processes more divisive than usual. Ecological data must be supplemented with scientific analysis of the key social factors relevant to a particular ecosystem. Objective social science analysis should be included on an equal basis with ecological science inquiry and with data from public involvement. A conceptual framework is presented to communicate to ecological scientists the potential array of social science contributions to ecosystem management.},

  Abstract                 = {Grassland birds are declining throughout their native range. The Flint Hills of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma contain large tracts of tallgrass prairie, but intensification of agricultural practices may be contributing to ongoing population declines. Common rangeland management practices include annual burning coupled with heavy grazing by cattle. This system, known as intensive early stocking and burning, promotes homogeneous utilization of forage by cattle but may not provide habitat for some grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative management system that aims to restore heterogeneity on rangelands by recreating the fire-grazing interaction that would have historically occurred throughout the Great Plains. From 2011-2013, we examined responses of grassland birds to traditional rangeland management and patch-burn grazing by conducting vegetation surveys, line transect surveys, and nest monitoring on privately-owned pastures in Chase County and Greenwood County, Kansas. Vegetative heterogeneity was higher on patch-burned pastures, with unburned patches having higher visual obstruction and less bare ground. Densities of grassland birds differed by species and among habitat strata. Unburned patches on patch-burned pastures were associated with increased densities of Dickcissels (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) and Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum). Henslowâ€™s Sparrows (A. henslowii) were only detected on patch-burned pastures. Nest survival of grassland songbirds was similar among management systems but varied by year. Probability of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) varied among years and between treatments for Dickcissels and Grasshopper Sparrows, with overall lower rates on burned areas and during drought years. For Dickcissels and Grasshopper Sparrows, there was a significant reduction in host clutch size between parasitized versus unparasitized nests. Overall, nest survival of grassland songbirds in managed rangelands was low. Patch-burn grazing improved rangeland conditions and provided habitat for more species of birds, but did not increase nest survival. Drought conditions in 2012 and 2013 may have influenced the results of this study, as many landowners were unable to burn as planned. Further study is needed to determine underlying factors driving variation in nest success and parasitism rates for grassland birds, particularly on private lands which make up the vast majority of remnant tallgrass prairies.},

  Abstract                 = {[ABSTRACT. Working landscapes such as rangelands are increasingly recognized as having high conservation value, providing a variety of ecosystem services, including food, fiber, habitat, recreation, open space, carbon storage, and water, in addition to a broad range of social benefits. However, conversion of rangelands to other land uses has been prevalent throughout the western United States, leading to greater attention in the conservation community to the importance of collaborating with private landowners. The level of interest in collaborative conservation among private landowners and the types of conservation programs they choose to participate in depend on the social, economic, and environmental context. We used GIS analysis and interviews with ranchers to evaluate rangeland conversion and participation in conservation programs among ranchers in San Diego County, California, USA, which is part of a biodiversity hotspot with high plant species richness and a large number of endemic and rare species. We found that 21,210 ha (3.1\%) of rangelands were converted to other uses over the past 25 years, primarily for urbanization, while the area of public rangeland increased by 9\%. Interviews revealed that ranchers in San Diego County have had limited involvement with most conservation programs, and a critical factor for nonparticipation was providing programs access to private land, along with other issues related to trust and social values. Among ranchers who had participated in conservation programs, the payment level and the agency or organization administering the program were key factors. Our results provide insight into factors influencing whether and when ranchers are likely to participate in conservation initiatives and illustrate that private and public land conservation are strongly linked and would be more effective if the two strategies were better integrated.]},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to determine stocker BW gain on patch-burned native tall-grass prairie while also determining plant species influenced by fire. The study was conducted in a split-block experimental design where treatments consisted of a yearly spring burn on the pastures (CON) or patch burning of one-third pasture per year (PB). Stocker steers grazed the pastures using a three-quarter-season (\textasciitilde{}114 d) grazing period from about mid-April to mid-August from 2006 to 2012. Steer ADG, final weight, and total BW gain were not different by treatment (P {$>$} 0.35). However, when comparing treatment effects with precipitation classification (high, average, low), cattle on PB had a greater ADG (P = 0.02; 0.10 kg/d), final weight (P = 0.07; 12 kg), and total BW gain (P = 0.02; 11.8 kg) in low precipitation years (2011 and 2012). Overall, patch burning provides similar BW gains as yearly burning on native tall-grass prairie, while providing a BW gain advantage in low precipitation years. The switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) population declined (P {$<$} 0.05) on CON treatment, whereas the population of other perennial grasses increased. The amount of annual grasses, including hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and yellow foxtail (Setaria pumila), increased (P {$<$} 0.05) under PB. Botanical composition shifts were similar on patch-burn pastures and full-burn pastures, with the exception of increasing annual grasses with patch burning.},

  Abstract                 = {Freshwater ecosystems have the greatest species diversity per unit area and many endangered species. This book shows that, rather than being a marginal part of terrestrial protected area management, freshwater conservation is central to sustaining biodiversity. It focuses on better practices for conserving inland aquatic ecosystems in protected areas, including rivers, wetlands, peatlands, other freshwater and brackish ecosystems, and estuaries. The authors define inland aquatic ecosystems, showing just how diverse and widespread they are. They examine the principles and processes that are essential for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species. Major categories of threats to freshwater ecosystems and the flow-on implications for protected area design are described. Practical case studies are used to illustrate principles and practices applied around the world. Specific management needs of the main types of freshwater ecosystems are considered, as well as the management of freshwaters in the broader landscape, showing how natural resource governance processes can be harnessed to better manage freshwater biodiversity. The book offers commentary on how to adapt freshwater conservation practices to climate change and ends with an insightful synthesis.},

Along the Little Missouri River the largest floods typically result from snowmelt in March or April.

Subsequent channel migration allows seedlings to mature by protecting them from scour in floods and ice jams. Management actions that decrease channel movement will reduce cottonwood reproduction.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract High variability in precipitation and streamflow in the semiarid northern Great Plains causes large uncertainty in water availability. This uncertainty is compounded by potential effects of future climate change. We examined historical variability in annual and growing season precipitation, temperature, and streamflow within the Little Missouri River Basin and identified differences in the runoff response to precipitation for the period 1976?2012 compared to 1939?1975 (n~=~37~years in both cases). Computed mean values for the second half of the record showed little change ({$<$}5\%) in annual or growing season precipitation, but average annual runoff at the basin outlet decreased by 22\%, with 66\% of the reduction in flow occurring during the growing season. Our results show a statistically significant (p~{$<~$}0.10) 27\% decrease in the annual runoff response to precipitation (runoff ratio). Surface?water withdrawals for various uses appear to account for {$<$}12\% of the reduction in average annual flow volume, and we found no published or reported evidence of substantial flow reduction caused by groundwater pumping in this basin. Results of our analysis suggest that increases in monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures, including {$>$}1Â°C increases in January through March, are the dominant driver of the observed decrease in runoff response to precipitation in the Little Missouri River Basin.},

  Abstract                 = {This study was conducted to explore fungal endophyte communities inhabiting native switchgrass plants from the tallgrass prairie of northern Oklahoma. The primary focus was to isolate these endophytes in pure culture from surface-sterilized plant tissues and provide taxonomic identifications based on comparative analysis of ITS rDNA gene sequences. From these data, we evaluated the biodiversity of these potentially beneficial endosymbionts from this rapidly disappearing habitat of the Great Plains. While important from a strictly conservationist standpoint, this survey further allowed us to identify candidate endophytes for introduction into commercial switchgrass cultivars for biomass enhancement. A total of 210 whole plant samples were collected at early vegetative, full reproductive and senescence stages. Fungal endophytes were isolated, identified to species level when possible, and grouped into communities based on plant part, collection month and part of the prairie from which the plants were collected. Species diversity for each community was estimated by Shannon diversity index, and differences in diversity indices were compared using a t-test. The presence of fungal species representing at least 18 taxonomic orders suggests a high level of diversity in switchgrass endophyte communities. The fungal communities from shoot tissue had significantly higher species diversity than communities from the root tissue. The abundance of taxa assigned to the order Hypocreales (to which mutualistic, clavicipitaceous endophytes of cool-season grasses belong) found in shoot (64\%) and root tissues (39\%) throughout the growing season suggests great potential for utilizing these endophytes for enhancing biomass production and stress resistance of this important bioenergy crop.},

Initial results show strong relationships among NDVI, NDWI, and drought conditions. During the summer over the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, the average NDVI and NDWI were consistently lower (NDVI {$<$} 0.5 and NDWI {$<$} 0.3) under drought conditions than under non?drought conditions (NDVI{$>$}0.6 and NDWI{$>$}0.4). NDWI values exhibited a quicker response to drought conditions than NDVI. Analysis revealed that combining information from visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared channels improved sensitivity to drought severity. The proposed normalized difference drought index (NDDI) had a stronger response to summer drought conditions than a simple difference between NDVI and NDWI, and is therefore a more sensitive indicator of drought in grasslands than NDVI alone.},

Laboratory estimates of net nitrogen mineralization were highest in soils from the more altered areas of prairie dog colonies (Cynomys ludovicianus) and lowest in the adjacent, lightly grazed, uncolonized grassland. The ratio of CO2: net nitrogen mineralized, as index of immobilization, was highest in the uncolonized grassland and lowest in the altered core areas. Soil moisture was an important modifier of in situ field estimates of net nitrogen mineralization. Root biomass, an important carbon source for decomposers in perennial grasslands, was lowest in the altered core area and highest in the adjacent uncolonised grassland. Decreased nitrogen immobilization and increased net nitrogen mineralization in the laboratory incubations likely resulted from decreased root carbon inputs in grazed areas, which limited carbon availability to decomposers. Such increases in plant?available nitrogen may partially explain the frequently reported grazing?induced increases in shoot nitrogen concentrations. These studies suggest that carbon allocation to roots is a key link determining nitrogen?cycling responses to herbivory.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is impacting upon global marine ecosystems and ocean wide changes in ecosystem properties are expected to continue. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a conservation tool throughout the world, primarily as a measure to reduce local impacts, but their usefulness and effectiveness is strongly related to climate change. MPAs may have a role in mitigation through effects on carbon sequestration, affect interactions between climatic effects and other drivers and be affected themselves as the distributions of protected species change over time. However, to date, few MPA programmes have directly considered climate change in the design, management or monitoring of an MPA network. This paper presents a series of international case studies from four locations: British Columbia, Canada; central California, USA; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand; to review perceptions of how climate change has been considered in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of MPAs. The results indicate that some MPA processes have already incorporated design criteria or principles for adaptive management, which address some of the potential impacts of climate change on MPAs. Key lessons include: i) Strictly protected marine reserves are considered essential for climate change resilience and will be necessary as scientific reference sites to understand climate change effects ii) Adaptive management of MPA networks is important but hard to implement iii) Strictly protected reserves managed as ecosystems are the best option for an uncertain future. Although the case studies addressed aspects of considering climate change within MPA networks and provided key lessons for the practical inclusion of these considerations, there are some significant challenges remaining. This paper provides new insights into the policy and practical challenges MPA managers face under climate change scenarios.},

The boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) was the most common amphibian in upland wetlands, followed by the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), plains spadefoot (Spea bombifrons) and the Great Plains toad (B. cognatus). Bufo woodhousii was the only species that bred in the river. Our records for reptiles are less complete than for amphibians but no losses from the community are evident.

  Abstract                 = {SummarySeasonal dynamics of soil nematodes and root biomass were examined from under western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii) and little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius) from a heavily grazed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colony occupied for 5 to 10 years and an adjacent lightly grazed, uncolonized area in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA. Nematodes were differentiated into classes of plant-parasitic Tylenchida and Dorylaimida and nonparasitic Dorylamida and Rhabditida. Root-feeding nematodes were generally more numerous from A. smithii than from A. scoparius, while nonparasitic populations were not different in soil from beneath the two plant species. Rhabditida, parasitic Dorylaimida and Tylenchida (from A. scoparius only) were more numerous on the prairie dog colony than from the uncolonized site, but nonparasitic Dorylaimida populations did not differ between the two areas. Mean total (live plus dead) root biomass beneath A. scoparius and A. smithii on the prairie dog colony averaged 71\% and 81\%, respectively, of values from the uncolonized area. Estimated consumption by root-feeding nematodes averaged 12.6\% and 5.8\% of annual net root production in the upper 10 cm from the prairie dog colony and uncolonized site, respectively. We conclude that, because of microhabitat modification or reductions in plant resistance to nematodes, heavy grazing by aboveground herbivores apparently facilitates grazing by belowground herbivores. Because heavily grazed plants have less roots than lightly grazed or ungrazed plants, the impact of root-feeding nematodes on primary producers is likely to be greatest in heavily grazed grasslands.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed a forage allocation model using a deterministic, linear optimization module in a commercially available spreadsheet package to help resource managers in Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP), North Dakota determine optimum numbers of four ungulate species, bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer(Odocoileus hemionus) , and feral horses, in the Park. TRNP staff actively managed bison, elk, and feral horse numbers within bounds suggested by our model from 1983 to 1996. During this period, we measured vegetation at 8 grassland and 12 wooded sites at 1â€“3 year intervals to determine if model solutions were appropriate for maintaining stable conditions in important plant communities in the Park. The data we recorded at these sites indicated minimal change in plant communities from 1983 to 1996. Changes in most vegetation categories that we expected when animal numbers exceeded model optimums for short periods (decreases in coverage/stem numbers of palatable plant species, increases in bare ground or unpalatable plant species) did not occur consistently under high or low precipitation conditions. The lack of sensitivity of our model to decreases in overall production of palatable plant species that occurred due to drought, fire, expansion of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies, and the spread of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) in areas of the Park where we did not have monitoring sites suggested that the model under-estimated the total number of ungulates that the Park could support. Management for population levels of ungulates defined by the model probably led to over protection of common plant communities and insufficient protection of rare plant communities. Detecting changes in rare plant communities could have been accomplished by re-designing our vegetation monitoring program, but changing emphasis to protection of rare plants would have likely promoted under use of grazing-tolerant habitat types, dissatisfaction in tourists visiting the Park to see large mammals, and large increases in cost and intrusiveness of management activities such as fencing and control of ungulate populations. The model was a flawed representation of grazing dynamics in TRNP, but we believe it succeeded in making management personnel aware of the biological constraints they face when making management decisions.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of value is central to the practice and science of ecological management and conservation. There is a well-developed body of theory and evidence that explores concepts of value in different ways across different disciplines including philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology. Insight from these disciplines provides a robust and sophisticated platform for considering the role of social values in ecological conservation, management and research. This paper reviews theories of value from these disciplines and discusses practical tools and instruments that can be utilised by researchers and practitioners. A distinction is highlighted between underlying values that shape people's perception of the world (e.g. altruistic or biospheric value orientations), and the values that people assign to things in the world (e.g. natural heritage, money). Evidence from numerous studies has shown that there are multiple pathways between these values and attitudes, beliefs and behaviours relevant to ecological management and conservation. In an age of increasing anthropogenic impacts on natural systems, recognising how and why people value different aspects of ecological systems can allow ecological managers to act to minimise conflict between stakeholders and promote the social acceptability of management activities. A series of practical guidelines are provided to enable social values to be better considered in ecosystem management and research.},

  Abstract                 = {Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is increasingly used to assess land use plans in a way that is broader in spatial, temporal and conceptual scope than traditional Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Meanwhile, conservation scientists have recognised that successful biodiversity conservation outcomes rely on information about both biological priorities and the feasibility of undertaking conservation actions. SEA provides a framework for integrating information on the social determinants of conservation feasibility with supporting environmental legislation in order to achieve enhanced conservation outcomes. In this paper we argue that data on the social context of land use plans are vital to ensure effective biodiversity conservation outcomes that result from SEAs. We explore the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) (EPBC Act) as a case example of how the integration of these data can be practically achieved within an existing legal process. While a range of social data is relevant to this type of assessment, we focus on the use of spatially-referenced social data in the context of land use planning. When applied to the design and implementation of land use plans, this type of information can improve the acceptability of conservation actions, enhance environmental stewardship, and minimise land use conflict through taking stock of the values and attitudes (precursors to behaviour) that are relevant to proposed land use change and conservation action. Through exploring the integration of these data into each of the stages of SEA under the EPBC Act, we show that opportunities exist to strengthen the effectiveness of SEA in delivering conservation outcomes without altering existing legal processes. Yet, for this to be done effectively, practitioners need to be cognisant of a range of theoretical and methodological challenges related to the generation and interpretation of these data, as well as the socio-political context in which they are applied.},

  Abstract                 = {Agricultural intensification has fragmented rangelands in the Great Plains, which has contributed to uniform and homogeneous landscapes and decreased biodiversity. Alternative land management practices involving fire-grazing interactions can help maintain biodiversity without affecting livestock productivity. A survey was designed to understand the factors that influence preferences among the general population towards grassland landscape heterogeneity. Given the ordinal nature of survey responses, requisite data were analyzed using a generalized ordinal logit model. Results suggested that respondents who valued open space and those who recognized a need for a varying mix of uniform grasses and grasslands preferred landscape heterogeneity. Female respondents were about two times as likely to prefer heterogeneous landscapes compared to male respondents. In contrast, population groups that preferred wildlife habitat did not desire heterogeneous landscapes. Results suggest the need for extension and outreach activities to educate certain segments of the general population regarding benefits of alternative management practices that support landscape heterogeneity in the Great Plains.

In order to mitigate the negative impacts of drought, adoption of pro-environmental measures is imperative. While there is an increasing pressure on farmers to support environmental conservation practices, factors influencing their pro-environmental behavior remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, protection motivation theory (PMT) was used as a basis for identification of the main determinants of the farmers' pro-environmental behavior under drought. A survey of 274 farmers in the Fars Province, selected through a multistage stratified random sampling method, revealed that some farmers postponed the protection measures when facing severe sustained drought. In addition, a low tendency of adopting strategies that are appropriate for reducing the environmental impacts of drought was observed. Analysis of the Bayesian network and partial least squares (PLS) path model illustrated that response efficacy, perceived severity, response costs, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, income, and social environment significantly influenced the farmers' pro-environmental behavior under drought. Recommendations and implications for the promotion of pro-environmental behaviors are offered to reduce the negative environmental impacts of drought.},

The projections of general circulation models (GCMs) indicate the possible magnitude and direction of future climate change for a region, but the utility of these projections for more local scales, those of individual National Park Service (NPS) units, are more uncertain because the coarse-scale GCMs lack much of the topographic detail that alters local climates. In addition, complex, interacting effects of temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, fire, and herbivores on the vegetation that is the foundational natural resource of many NPS units present challenges in assessing the effects of projected future climates on plant and animal assemblages managed by the NPS.

This paper first examines the bison's prehistory, migrations to North America, relationship with North American Native American cultures, and events leading to the nineteenth century near-extinction. It then discusses early conservation successes, including the work of individuals and organizations that made this possible. This paper focuses on mainly the prospects for bison protection today in the face of strong challenges such as bison-cattle (Bos Taurus Bojanus) interbreeding and the threat of bison genomic extinction. This work is being carried out by bison protection organizations and a Department of the Interior (DOI) bison working group. Their goals include finding and establishing connected habitats wherein buffalo can roam and migrate as they did historically across broad ranges. Maintaining genetic integrity and creating safe habitats for bison herds can lead to long-term viability.},

  Abstract                 = {Global biodiversity is threatened by invasive plant species. Without a thorough understanding of eï¬€ective management strategies, minimizing their impacts while improving native species diversity will be challenging. Burning in ï¬�re-prone landscapes has been successful for managing invasive species and increasing native biodiversity, but it is unclear how speciï¬�c ï¬�re regimes improve restoration practices in novel ecosystems where invasive plants have a similar growth phenology to native plants. We investigated ï¬�re as a restoration practice in the Northern Great Plains to decrease the cover of Kentucky bluegrass Poa pratensis (bluegrass), a perennial coolseason invasive grass phenologically similar to dominant native cool-season grasses, by 1) evaluating season of burn (early-growing season, late-growing season, and dormant season) in a ï¬�eld experiment to test diï¬€erences in plant community composition and 2) manipulating ï¬�ne fuels (3000â€“5000 kg haâˆ’1) in an experimental approach to determine the eï¬€ects of ï¬�re on plant survivability of selected native grasses and bluegrass. Bluegrass cover decreased 27\% on all ï¬�eld burned plots the ï¬�rst year post-ï¬�re. Three years post-ï¬�re, late-growing season and dormant season treatments had 35\% less bluegrass, whereas the early-growing season treatment was not signiï¬�cantly diï¬€erent from the control. Overall, ï¬�re altered the native plant community, with native plants more associated with burned plots. However, native plant community changes were only evident three years post-ï¬�re in late-growing season and dormant season burn treatments. In the experimental approach, native grasses and bluegrass experienced high rates of mortality (40â€“50\%) at fuel loads above 4000 kg haâˆ’1 and heat dosages above 30,000 Â°CÂ·sec, features commonly associated with early-growing season burns. Therefore, early-growing season burns meant to reduce bluegrass may also impact native plants dominant in the region. Invasive species management is complicated in novel ecosystems when invasive plants have similar growth phenologies to native species. Control eï¬€orts should consider how diï¬€erent management strategies impact invasive and native plants alike. We found that late-growing season and dormant season burns, along with higher fuel loads, decreased bluegrass cover. Determining mechanisms of control in ï¬�re-prone landscapes is a crucial step to improving invasive plant control and increasing native biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of pollinating insects are generalists whose lifetimes overlap flowering periods of many potentially suitable plant species. Such generality is instrumental in allowing exotic plant species to invade pollination networks. The particulars of how existing networks change in response to an invasive plant over the course of its phenology are not well characterized, but may shed light on the probability of long-term effects on plant-pollinator interactions and the stability of network structure. Here we describe changes in network topology and modular structure of infested and non-infested networks during the flowering season of the generalist non-native flowering plant, Cirsium arvense in mixed-grass prairie at Badlands National Park, South Dakota, USA. Objectives were to compare network-level effects of infestation as they propagate over the season in infested and non-infested (with respect to C. arvense) networks. We characterized plant-pollinator networks on 5 non-infested and 7 infested 1-ha plots during 4 sample periods that collectively covered the length of C. arvense flowering period. Two other abundantly-flowering invasive plants were present during this time: Melilotus officinalis had highly variable floral abundance in both C. arvense-infested and non-infested plots and Convolvulus arvensis, which occurred almost exclusively in infested plots and peaked early in the season. Modularity, including roles of individual species, and network topology were assessed for each sample period as well as in pooled infested and non-infested networks. Differences in modularity and network metrics between infested and non-infested networks were limited to the third and fourth sample periods, during flower senescence of C. arvense and the other invasive species; generality of pollinators rose concurrently, suggesting rewiring of the network and a lag effect of earlier floral abundance. Modularity was lower and number of connectors higher in infested networks, whether they were assessed in individual sample periods or pooled into infested and non-infested networks over the entire blooming period of C. arvense. Connectors typically did not reside within the same modules as C. arvense, suggesting that effects of the other invasive plants may also influence the modularity results, and that effects of infestation extend to co-flowering native plants. We conclude that the presence of abundantly flowering invasive species is associated with greater network stability due to decreased modularity, but whether this is advantageous for the associated native plant-pollinator communities depends on the nature of perturbations they experience.},

In an attempt to understand the underlying institutional factors that either support or contest this assumption, this paper explores the institutional factors influencing adaptation to climate change at the regional scale, where multiple public land and natural resource management jurisdictions are involved. Insights from two mid-western US case studies reveal that several challenges to collaboration persist and prevent fully integrative multi-jurisdictional adaptation planning at a regional scale. We propose that some of these challenges, such as lack of adequate time, funding and communication channels, be reframed as opportunities to build interdependence, identify issue-linkages and collaboratively explore the nature and extent of organisational trade-offs with respect to regional climate change adaptation efforts. Such a reframing can better facilitate multi-jurisdictional adaptation planning and management of shared biophysical resources generally while simultaneously enhancing organisational capacity to mitigate negative effects and take advantage of potentially favourable future conditions in an era characterised by rapid climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Rangelands are ï¬�re-dependent ecosystems severely altered through direct ï¬�re suppression and fuels management. The removal of ï¬�re is a dominant cause of ecological sites moving across thresholds with the majority of North American rangelands currently showing moderate or high departure from reference conditions. Recognizing the need to restore ï¬�re on rangelands and incorporate prescribed ï¬�re into management plans, the Natural Resource Conservation Service initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) to evaluate the validity current practices through peer-reviewed scientiï¬�c literature. We updated the CEAP review and broadened the discussion of prescribed ï¬�re as a global management practice. We reviewed and summarized prescribed ï¬�re literature available through Web of Science using search terms in the title. The majority of literature (40\%) evaluated plant responses to ï¬�re with ï¬�re behavior and management (29\%), wildlife and arthropods (12\%), soils (11\%), and air quality (4\%) evaluated less frequently. Generally, ï¬�re effects on plants are neutral to positive and the majority of negative responses lasted less than 2 years. Similarly, soil responses were recovered within 2 yr after burning. However, most studies did not report how long treatments were in place (62\%) or the size of experimental units (52\%). The experimental literature supporting prescribed burning is in need of greater managerial relevance that can be obtained by directly addressing spatial scale, temporal scale, and interaction with other disturbances, including drought and grazing. Reliance on information from single ï¬�res applied on small plots tracked for a relatively short time interval greatly constrains inferences and application to ecosystem management and information should be applied with caution. Therefore, conservation purposes need to incorporate temporal dynamics to the extent that this information is available. The complex interaction of scientiï¬�c knowledge, social concerns, and variable policies across regions are major limitations to the successful and critical restoration of ï¬�re regimes.},

Between 1992 and 1996, the frequency of weevil damage to native thistles consistently increased, reaching 16 to 77 percent of flowerheads per plant. Weevils significantly reduced the seed production of native thistle flowerheads. The density of native tephritid flies was significantly lower at high weevil density.

  Abstract                 = {Describing fish habitat associations and their relevance to conservation remains a central challenge in stream fish ecology. Unfortunately, there are limited opportunities to investigate these associations in unaltered systems and identify critical habitats used by native fishes. Investigation of fish habitat associations in tallgrass prairie is especially vital, owing to their widespread destruction. Our study aim was to identify habitat factors associated with the distribution and density of fishes in two protected tallgrass prairie stream watersheds in eastern Kansas: Kings Creek on the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) and Fox Creek on the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve (TPNP). We sampled fishes and measured eight habitat variables at three sites on KPBS (2006â€“2011) and four sites on TPNP (2008â€“2011). Multiple regression suggested that species richness was positively associated with pool area (partial r {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.70) and discharge (partial r {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.50) in Fox Creek (df {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 15, Adj. R2 {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.60, P {$<$} 0.001). In Kings Creek, species richness was only associated with pool area (df {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 17, R2 {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.44, P {$<$} 0.001). Redundancy analyses showed common prairie fish species exhibit ontogenetic habitat associations, partitioning adults in deep and juveniles in shallow pools. Strong species area relationships in these minimally altered systems indicates large volume habitats have greater species richness, suggesting water diversions or extractions that reduce habitat are likely to cause declines in native biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Drought is a natural part of the historical climate variability in the northern Rocky Mountains and high plains region of the United States. However, recent drought impacts and climate change projections have increased the need for a systematized way to document and understand drought in a manner that is meaningful to public land and resource managers. The purpose of this exploratory study was to characterize the ways in which some federal and tribal natural resource managers experienced and dealt with drought on lands managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and tribes in two case site examples (northwest Colorado and southwest South Dakota) that have experienced high drought exposure in the last two decades. The authors employed a socialâ€“ecological system framework, whereby key informant interviews and local and regional drought indicator data were used characterize the social and ecological factors that contribute to drought vulnerability and the ways in which drought onset, persistence, severity, and recovery impact management. Results indicated that local differences in the timing, decisions, and specific management targets defined within the local socialâ€“ecological natural resource contexts are critical to understanding drought impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses. These findings suggest that manager-defined socialâ€“ecological contexts are critically important to understand how drought is experienced across the landscape and the indices that are needed to inform adaptation and response strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Population declines of grassland birds over the past 30 yr have followed the widespread implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that create homogenous grassland habitats. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) was tested as an alternative management technique that is ecologically similar to historically heterogeneous fire and grazing regimes and holds promise as a rangeland management tool that may benefit grassland wildlife. We conducted a 3-year study to compare nest-site selection and nest survival of greater prairie-chickens, an umbrella species for tallgrass prairie conservation, on private lands managed with PBG or intensive fire and grazing in the Flint Hills of Kansas. The goal of our field study was to evaluate the relationships among rangeland management practices, habitat conditions, and nesting ecology of greater prairie-chickens. Nest-site selection and nest survival of prairie-chickens were both directly related to vertical nesting cover, which was determined by the fire return interval of a pasture. Nesting habitat was affected little by stocking rate in PBG management regimes because preferred nest sites were unburned patches that were not grazed by cattle. Overall, the quantity and quality of nesting sites was improved under PBG management when compared with more intensive rangeland management regimes. Our results join a growing body of evidence that rangeland management strategies that mimic historical heterogeneous fire and grazing regimes benefit native species of prairie wildlife.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulation models can represent complexities of the real world and serve as virtual laboratories for asking â€œwhat ifâ€¦?â€� questions about how systems might respond to different scenarios. However, simulation models have limited relevance to real-world applications when designed without input from people who could use the simulated scenarios to inform their decisions. Here, we report on a state-and-transition simulation model of vegetation dynamics that was coupled to a scenario planning process and co-produced by researchers, resource managers, local subject-matter experts, and climate change adaptation specialists to explore potential effects of climate scenarios and management alternatives on key resources in southwest South Dakota. Input from management partners and local experts was critical for representing key vegetation types, bison and cattle grazing, exotic plants, fire, and the effects of climate change and management on rangeland productivity and composition given the paucity of published data on many of these topics. By simulating multiple land management jurisdictions, climate scenarios, and management alternatives, the model highlighted important tradeoffs between grazer density and vegetation composition, as well as between the short- and long-term costs of invasive species management. It also pointed to impactful uncertainties related to the effects of fire and grazing on vegetation. More broadly, a scenario-based approach to model co-production bracketed the uncertainty associated with climate change and ensured that the most important (and impactful) uncertainties related to resource management were addressed. This cooperative study demonstrates six opportunities for scientists to engage users throughout the modeling process to improve model utility and relevance: (1) identifying focal dynamics and variables, (2) developing conceptual model(s), (3) parameterizing the simulation, (4) identifying relevant climate scenarios and management alternatives, (5) evaluating and refining the simulation, and (6) interpreting the results. We also reflect on lessons learned and offer several recommendations for future co-production efforts, with the aim of advancing the pursuit of usable science.},

  Abstract                 = {We used a stochastic Leslie matrix model parameterized with demographic data from Wind Cave National Park to evaluate effects of four culling strategies on population growth rates and age and sex structure of bison (Bison bison Linnaeus). The four culling scenarios we modeled included removal of: (1) yearlings only; (2) calf/cow combination; (3) a herd-wide proportional cull (i.e., individuals taken in proportion to their availability); and (4) calves only. We also allowed either one, two, or three years to elapse between culls to mimic current management activities, and chose culling values for each scenario that would maintain a stable population (i.e., Î» â‰ˆ 1.00). In the absence of culling, our model projected a growth rate of 16\% per year (Î»= 1.16) (SD = 0.02) for the Wind Cave bison population. The modeled population was characterized by a unimodal age structure for bulls and cows and a 1:1 bull: cow ratio. Removal of 75\% of the yearlings or 75\% of the calves every year was needed to maintain abundance at current size. These culling strategies altered the age distribution from baseline conditions, resulting in nearly equal proportions of age classes 2â€“15. When yearling culling or calf removal was skipped one year or two consecutive years, the yearling or calf removal option resulted in positive population growth even in the presence of a 90\% cull. Because these strategies nearly removed entire cohorts, corresponding gaps were introduced in the age structure. About 40\% of calves and 20\% of cows needed to be removed under the annual calf/cow cull to stabilize population growth, producing a unimodal age structure of cows. However, the proportion of bulls in the 2â€“16 age classes increased, and the proportion of males was nearly equal across the middle age classes. The proportional cull, regardless of time between culling operations, resulted in the most symmetric age structure for males and females. To achieve Î» â‰ˆ 1.00 under a proportional cull strategy, 16\% of all animals would need to be removed annually, 33\% every other year, or 50\% once every three years. Sensitivity and elasticity analysis indicated that adult females (5â€“13 years old) were the most important group of bison affectingÎ». These modeled effects, along with factors such as logistical constraints, costs, efficacy, viewing opportunities for tourists, genetics, behavior, and agency policies should be considered when managers choose among culling strategies. When considering historical predation and harvest by Native Americans, we hypothesize that the calf/cow combination cull would have most closely approximated natural bison demographics after the widespread availability of horses (Equus spp.) in the year 1735. Before 1735, we hypothesize that the proportional cull would most closely represent historic conditions, although even this option might not reproduce the variability inherent in historical bison dynamics. We discuss the possibility and management implications of variable culling that might more closely mimic historical influences on bison populations on the Northern Great Plains.},

The most common species in riffles were Orangethroat Darter (Etheostoma spectabile), Redfin Shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis), and Central Stoneroller (Compostoma anomalum), and the most common species in pools were Redfin Shiner, Central Stoneroller, and Orangespotted Sunfish (Lepomis humilis). Species richness and abundance were higher in pools than riffles, however evenness was not statistically significantly different. Since this study was conducted in the middle of a severe drought, these results could provide important data on how fish communities are assembled during periods of low-flow in tallgrass prairie streams.},

  Abstract                 = {Governance failures are at the origin of many resource management problems. In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific. First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice.},

One potential solution is to bring cultural ecosystem services more strongly into the foreground. We synthesize recent empirical evidence and assess what consideration of cultural ecosystem services adds to landscape management and planning. In general, cultural ecosystem services incentivize the multifunctionality of landscapes. However, depending on context, cultural ecosystem services can either encourage the maintenance of valuable landscapes or act as barriers to necessary innovation and transformation. Hence, cultural ecosystems services are not uncontested, as seen through the three analytical lenses of landowner behavior, cultural practices of communities, and landscape planning.},

  Abstract                 = {Habitat manipulations through the use of fire or mechanical treatments are often used to combat woody plant encroachment and increase foraging opportunities for wildlife and livestock. This creates spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality that large herbivores should respond to in ways predicted by ideal free distribution theory. We monitored free-ranging bison to test whether, (1) manipulated habitats offer higher quality forage than habitats in undisturbed rangeland, (2) bison respond through changes in herd composition or activity to differences in habitat quality, and (3) burned and mechanically treated habitats offer similar forage qualities. We found that habitat types burned âˆ¼10 years ago continue to produce higher quality forage as evidenced by bison fecal N concentration (14.4gkgâˆ’1 dry mass) than open (10.5gkgâˆ’1), closed (10.6gkgâˆ’1), or mechanically manipulated habitats (11.7gkgâˆ’1). Bison herd composition and activity did not vary across habitat types within seasons, despite some between-season variation in overall group composition with sexual segregation being most evident before mid-summer. For semi-arid rangelands encroached with woody vegetation (e.g. piÃ±onâ€“juniper in the western USA) our evidence from free-ranging bison indicates that burning results in higher quality forage than occurs in both mechanically manipulated and undisturbed habitats. Bison roam widely from water, sample available vegetation continuously, and are long-lived gregarious animals that learn to exploit the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in their large home ranges. Bison also have very similar diets to cattle and so, where bison and cattle are allowed to comingle, we suggest the foraging parameters of free-ranging bison are effective ecological indicators of rangeland quality for both bison and cattle.},

We performed a meta-analysis of 29 studies from 13different grassland/savanna communities in North America to determine the consequences ofwoody encroachment on plant species richness. In all 13 communities, species richnessdeclined with woody plant encroachment (average declineÂ¼45\%). Species richness declinedmore in communities with higher precipitation (r2Â¼0.81) and where encroachment wasassociated with a greater change in annual net primary productivity (ANPP;r2Â¼0.69). Basedon the strong positive correlation between precipitation and ANPP following encroachment(r2Â¼0.87), we hypothesize that these relationships occur because water-limited woody plantsexperience a greater physiological and demographic release as precipitation increases. Theobserved relationship between species richness and ANPP provides support for the theoreticalexpectation that a trade-off occurs between richness and productivity in herbaceouscommunities. We conclude that woody plant encroachment leads to significant declines inspecies richness in North American grassland/savanna communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract:? Extensive habitat loss and changing agricultural practices have caused widespread declines in grassland birds throughout North America. The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma?the largest remaining tallgrass prairie?is important for grassland bird conservation despite supporting a major cattle industry. In 2004 and 2005, we assessed the community, population, and demographic responses of grassland birds to the predominant management practices (grazing, burning, and haying) of the region, including grasslands restored under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We targeted 3 species at the core of this avian community: the Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Bird diversity was higher in native prairie hayfields and grazed pastures than CRP fields, which were dominated by Dickcissels. Although Dickcissel density was highest in CRP, their nest success was highest and nest parasitism by Brown?headed Cowbirds (Moluthrus ater) lowest in unburned hayfields (in 2004). Conversely, Grasshopper Sparrow density was highest in grazed pastures, but their nest success was lowest in these pastures and highest in burned hayfields, where cowbird parasitism was also lowest (in 2004). Management did not influence density and nest survival of Eastern Meadowlarks, which were uniformly low across the region. Nest success was extremely low (5?12\%) for all 3 species in 2005, perhaps because of a record spring drought. Although the CRP has benefited grassland birds in agricultural landscapes, these areas may have lower habitat value in the context of native prairie. Hayfields may provide beneficial habitat for some grassland birds in the Flint Hills because they are mowed later in the breeding season than elsewhere in the Midwest. Widespread grazing and annual burning have homogenized habitat?and thus grassland?bird responses?across the Flint Hills. Diversification of management practices could increase habitat heterogeneity and enhance the conservation potential of the Flint Hills for grassland birds.},

Forb, shrub and graminoid biomasses were greater in the unburned Festuca community than in the StipaAgropyron type. Spring and autumn burning delayed early season growth of graminoids in both grassland types in the 1st growing season after fire. Peak green biomass was reached later in the season in burned plots relative to reference areas. Plant growth in the spring of the 2nd yr after fire was more rapid in burned plots and peak biomass was reached earlier than in the reference plots. Autumn burning reduced forb biomass significantly early in the growing season during 1 of 3 yr that this parameter was measured. No effect of burning on shrub biomass was detected. Autumn and spring burning of Festuca grassland reduced peak, green, graminoid biomass production in the 1st and 2nd yr after fire; autumn burning had the most negative effect. Reductions in graminoid biomass after burning Stipa-Agropyron stands were smaller than in the Festuca community. Nitrogen concentrations in F. scabrella shoots regrown after fire were higher than those from the reference areas. Soil water content during the growing season, and snow trapping were reduced by burning. Peak green biomass and total graminoid biomass in Festuca grassland recovered to the level of the reference plots 2-3 yr after burning. Recovery was slower in the Stipa-Agropyron community.},

  Abstract                 = {The need for cross-disciplinary scientific inquiries that facilitate improved natural resource management outcomes through increased understanding of both the biophysical and human dimensions of management issues has been widely recognized. Despite this broad recognition, a number of obstacles and barriers still sometimes challenge the successful implementation of cross-disciplinary approaches. Improving understanding of these challenges and barriers will help address them and thereby foster appropriate and effective utilization of cross-disciplinary approaches to solve natural resource management challenges. This research uses a case study analysis of the United States National Estuarine Research Reserve System to improve understanding of the critical factors that influence practitionersâ€™ decisions related to incorporating social science into their natural resource management work. The case study research is analyzed and evaluated within a Theory of Planned Behavior framework to (1) determine and describe the factors that predict practitionersâ€™ intent to incorporate social science into their natural resource related activities and (2) recommend potential strategies for encouraging and enabling cross-disciplinary approaches to natural resource management. The results indicate that National Estuarine Research Reserve practitionersâ€™ decisions related to incorporating social science are primarily influenced by (1) confidence in their own capability to incorporate social science into their work and (2) beliefs about whether the outcomes of incorporating social science into their work would be valuable or beneficial.},

  Abstract                 = {1. In trying to operationalize the notion of sustainable ecosystem health, ecologists have focused on identifying sets of indicators which can be used to assess river condition relative to some normative, undegraded condition. Recognition and description of this normative state has proved elusive, particularly in highly variable semiarid ecosystems. Without an operational definition of the desired system condition that reflects both scientific rigour and broader societal value systems, rivers are unlikely to be managed effectively. 2. Managing river health should not be confused with measuring it. Many monitoring or assessment programs become ends in themselves instead of being the means to achieving specific management goals. The absence of a test of the results of monitoring further introduces the risk of management by observation and â€˜pseudo-factâ€™. Health â€˜endpointsâ€™ provide a scientific description of management goals, while â€˜valuesâ€™ provide a societal perspective. Together they complement the use of indicators and provide the basis for a strategic rather than reactive approach to management. 3. The integration of value systems, endpoints and indicators of ecosystem health or ecosystem integrity forms the cornerstone of a consultative management process for the rivers of the Kruger National Park. 4. An objectives hierarchy has been developed to service managementâ€™s institutional hierarchy. â€˜Visionâ€™ and objectives serve upper levels of management with value based statements of strategic intent which have been tested against public opinion. Goals provide managers on the ground with specific ecological endpoints termed â€˜thresholds of probable concernâ€™ (TPCs). TPCs are described by a range of spatially and temporally bounded indicators of the systemâ€™s response to the main potential agents of change. 5. TPCs represent statements or hypotheses of the limits of acceptable change in ecosystem structure, function and composition. They thereby provide an inductive and strategic approach to adaptive management in a data poor situation. Integrated monitoring, research and modelling track criteria relative to TPCs and question whether management action, or recalibration of the TPC, is needed. TPCs thus provide direction for management but their validity and appropriateness are frequently challenged and adaptively modified. 6. The objectives hierarchy gives Kruger Park management a mandate to â€˜maintain biodiversity in all its natural facets and fluxesâ€™. Alluviation, as a consequence of increased sediment supply and decreased sediment transport capacity, is a major threat to the biodiversity of the bedrock-controlled rivers which flow through the park. Thus, for example, TPCs for geomorphic diversity reflect permissible ranges of change in bedrock character of the physical template. They are measured as change in the proportion of different geomorphic units in identified representative reaches. TPCs for riparian vegetation are measured as change in population structure of selected species within the representative reaches. They reflect a likely range of biotic responses to change in the physical template. A specific set of indicators, reflecting response to the major agents of change, therefore provides a parsimonious program for assessing ecosystem condition relative to explicit goals and a clearly defined management process.},

  Abstract                 = {Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.},

Here, the effects of climatic â€œfactors over intermediateâ€�scale sites of relatively homogenous vegetative land cover are examined. Two areas of Kansas are selected for study: the shortgrass Sandsage Prairie in the southwest and the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in the eastâ€�central Flint Hills region. Within year and between year variation in vegetation in the context of climatic variability is examined on these sites using NOAA AVHRR data. Large increases in the strength of association between vegetative response (NDVI) and oneâ€�month lagged precipitation as compared to same month correlations are demonstrated. This does not bode well for the use of AVHRR NDVI as a â€œrealâ€�timeâ€� drought monitoring tool.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide a past and present biological baseline by which to understand North American prairies and to provide a platform for future conservation. Events both immediate to the end of the Pleistocene and historic suggest that the present grassland conditions are different from those within which most of the grassland organisms evolved. Our analysis suggests that few grassland landscapes remain adequate in area and distribution to sustain diversity sufficient to include biota and ecological drivers native to the landscape. A robust and history-based scenario to conserve Great Plains grasslands is to 1) identify areas large enough to sustain an ecological system with all its biodiversity, 2) reverse significant losses in area of native grasslands, 3) ensure that restoration matches the grassland previously existing at that site, 4) refocus the profession of range management, and 5) establish a more meaningful agency design for grassland and natural resource management.},

Estimates of age-specific survival are necessary to evaluate the potential for population growth of reintroduced populations. We used 7 years (2003â€“2009) of captureâ€“recapture data of 243 pups, 29 yearlings, and 69 adult swift foxes at BNP and the surrounding area to construct Cormackâ€“Jollyâ€“Seber model estimates of apparent survival within a captureâ€“markâ€“recapture framework using Program MARK. The best model for estimating recapture probabilities included no differences among age classes, greater recapture probabilities during early years of the monitoring effort than later years, and variation among spring, winter, and summer. Our top ranked survival model indicated pup survival differed from that of yearlings and adults and varied by month and year. The apparent annual survival probability of pups (0.47, SE = 0.10) in our study area was greater than the apparent annual survival probability of yearlings and adults (0.27, SE = 0.08). Our results indicate low survival probabilities for a reintroduced population of swift foxes in the BNP and surrounding areas. Management of reintroduced populations and future reintroductions of swift foxes should consider the effects of relative low annual survival on population demography.},

  Abstract                 = {Earthâ€™s forests provide many benefits and services to people and yet human land-use patterns have greatly altered the forest landscape on a global scale, reducing the quantity and quality of forest resources. Land-use patterns and processes in forested environments are the byproduct of peopleâ€™s perceptions of the forest and its values, human behaviors that modify the forest, and policies that regulate these behaviors. In the Pacific Northwest, USA, and British Columbia, Canada, differences in peopleâ€™s perceptions of the forest and itâ€™s values has resulted in changes to forest management policies in both regions.  
This dissertation examines the relationships between changing policies in the PNW and BC and changes in management practices and forest manager perceptions of forest resource management, and it will examine and compare how these changes contribute to forest distribution patterns in different ecological settings utilizing observations of natural resource management conferences, content analysis of semi-structured interviews with forestry professionals, and analyses of forest canopy cover change in sample regions of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia utilizing ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS technologies.  
The observations of conferences provide a general indication of three recurring topics of importance to forest management in both regions: management techniques and approaches, stakeholder relationships, and ecosystem protection. Content analysis revealed changing perspectives and practices amongst forest managers, though the changes observed depended to some extent on whether the professional worked within a public agency or with private industry. The analyses of canopy cover changes revealed a loss of forest canopy over the course of the study time frame, but the losses were not equally distributed between owner and tenure classes. Policy implementation did seem to affect changes to canopy cover for the policyâ€™s targeted owner or tenure class. This research contributes to a better understanding of the interactions between human systems and ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Grassland ecosystems store an estimated 30\% of the world's total soil C and are frequently disturbed by wildfires or fire management. Aboveground litter decomposition is one of the main processes that form soil organic matter (SOM). However, during a fire biomass is removed or partially combusted and litter inputs to the soil are substituted with inputs of pyrogenic organic matter (py?OM). Py?OM accounts for a more recalcitrant plant input to SOM than fresh litter, and the historical frequency of burning may alter C and N retention of both fresh litter and py?OM inputs to the soil. We compared the fate of these two forms of plant material by incubating 13C? and 15N?labeled Andropogon gerardii litter and py?OM at both an annually burned and an infrequently burned tallgrass prairie site for 11~months. We traced litter and py?OM C and N into uncomplexed and organo?mineral SOM fractions and CO2 fluxes and determined how fire history affects the fate of these two forms of aboveground biomass. Evidence from CO2 fluxes and SOM C:N ratios indicates that the litter was microbially transformed during decomposition while, besides an initial labile fraction, py?OM added to SOM largely untransformed by soil microbes. Additionally, at the N?limited annually burned site, litter N was tightly conserved. Together, these results demonstrate how, although py?OM may contribute to C and N sequestration in the soil due to its resistance to microbial degradation, a long history of annual removal of fresh litter and input of py?OM infers N limitation due to the inhibition of microbial decomposition of aboveground plant inputs to the soil. These results provide new insight into how fire may impact plant inputs to the soil, and the effects of py?OM on SOM formation and ecosystem C and N cycling.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Understanding species habitat selection and factors that drive selection are key components for conservation. We report the first resource selection functions (RSFs) for bison inhabiting an arid ecosystem and use them with density estimates of bison to estimate the number of bison that could be supported if the bison range were expanded to federal lands in the San Luis Valley of Colorado. We derived RSFs for vegetation types using locations of plains bison collected weekly over 3 years from 2005 to 2007. Bison selected for wet or mesic grassland habitats in all seasons. Wetland selection by bison was predicted to be 18 times greater than that of rabbitbrush vegetation, the reference category, and selection of meadows was predicted to be 11 times greater than that of the rabbitbrush type. Willow?dominated plant communities were strongly avoided. Cottonwood communities were also avoided, with the exception of some moderate levels of selection in fall. The willow and cottonwood communities have an understory with low biomass of herbaceous species and low productivity in this arid system. Based on the RSFs we predicted that in the San Luis Valley of Colorado up to 2,379 bison could be supported in similar habitats under Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) jurisdiction, and up to 759 bison could be supported on adjacent National Park Service (NPS) land. This modeling framework provides a conservation tool for the restoration of bison to their historical habitats, and has utility for application to other terrestrial species where assumptions are met.

We explored the potential for incentives to encourage landowners to manage land cover for the benefit of endangered songbirds in central Texas (U.S.A.) by asking landowners to indicate their preferences for financial incentives, technical assistance, and regulatory assurances. We identified owners of potential songbird habitat and collected data in face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires. We used a latent-class stated-choice model to identify 3 classes of landowners whose choices varied on the basis of their attitudes and perceived social norms: (1) strong positive attitude, perceived social pressure to participate, and willing to participate with relatively few incentives, (2) weak positive attitude, perceived no social pressure to participate, and required strongest incentives, and (3) negative attitude, perceived social pressure not to enroll, and unwilling to participate regardless of incentive structure. Given this heterogeneity in preferences, conservation incentives may increase management of land cover to benefit endangered species on private lands to some degree; however, exclusive reliance on incentives may be insufficient. Promoting conservation on private lands may be enhanced by integrating incentives into an approach that incorporates other strategies for conservation, including social networks and collaborative processes that reinforce social norms.},

However, examining the literature demonstrates there is very little joined up research to show that any particular governance approach results in improved ecological indices of fish stocks or biodiversity. Indeed, some of the well-cited examples of participatory governance implying improved ecological metrics are either incorrect (as data do not relate to MPAs under participatory governance systems), or do not provide any ecological data other than opinions of fishers to back up the claims. Evidence suggests that participatory governance approaches with equitable sharing of benefits can help the establishment and management of MPAs, and as such, there should be urgent further work assessing the ecological benefits that arise as a result of the establishment of MPAs with participatory and equitable governance approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Policymakers and managers are promoting Rangeland Fire Protection Associations (RFPA) as one way to better incorporate private citizens as active participants who contribute to fire suppression efforts on public rangelands. While the RFPA program is growing in popularity, little is known about the way that RFPAs establish and operate. This is especially true in mosaic management scenarios characterized by fragmented landownerships and a variety of land or fire management entities responsible for wildfire suppression. Our goal was to investigate how an RFPA forms and functions in a management scenario characterized by: 1) proximity to exurban residential development; 2) agreements with multiple local, state, and federal wildfire suppression entities; and 3) a geographically disperse protection district. We conducted in-depth interviews with RFPA members, land or fire management professionals, emergency managers, and local interest groups who interact with the Black Canyon RFPA (BCRFPA) in southwestern Idaho. We found that the BCRFPA leveraged the insights, documents and support of existing RFPAs during their establishment, but ultimately had to adapt the RFPA idea to specific elements of their local context. Members of nearby rural fire districts were initially apprehensive about the formation of the BCRFPA due to concerns about resource competition (e.g., funding and large equipment). RFPA members with professional firefighting experience helped alleviate those tensions by explaining how the RFPA would integrate into existing wildfire management networks. The BCRFPA provided local knowledge about road conditions, water resources, and fuel conditions and initial attack to fill in gaps in landscape-level wildfire protection. However, the proximity of residential areas to the BCRFPA protection district made decisions about fire suppression more complex by introducing trade-offs between residential and rangeland resource protections. Ultimately, our results indicate that RFPAs can help rangeland human populations better adapt to wildfire risk, but that social fragmentation may challenge RFPA functioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Fish sampling was conducted over a two-year period (May to August, 2004 and 2005) in seven streams traversing the Little Missouri River National Grassland and Theodore Roosevelt National Park, western North Dakota. Fish communities of the two stream types in the region (rolling prairie and badlands) differed significantly despite their close geographic proximity, overlapping by only 18\% in species composition and having only 8 of the 21 total fish species in common. As summer progressed, rolling prairie streams showed an increase in total fish density while total fish density in badland streams decreased. Badland and rolling prairie stream fish communities responded differently to the physical habitat variables of pool surface area, volume, mean depth, maximum depth, and width-to-depth ratio. Fish in badland streams appeared to be more susceptible to rapid physical habitat changes associated with late summer dewatering, while the more stable flows of rolling prairie streams prevented significant isolation of individuals in pools. Livestock grazing produced no significant detectable impacts to aquatic habitat availability. Streams within the region have always been subjected to contrasting natural periods of flood and drought, along with legacy effects of intensive domestic livestock grazing for more than a century. Conditions that impact fish assemblage structure, abundance, distribution, and survival are strongly influenced by changing physical habitat conditions such that the fish communities persist opportunistically within environmental instability. Naturally harsh, highly variable conditions and a lack of adequate experimental domestic livestock exclosures complicate proper evaluation of effects of land use practices. Establishment of some long-term, extensive exclosures over a period of years or decades would facilitate the evaluation of the roles of abiotic factors, biotic factors, and land use practices in shaping fish communities.},

  Abstract                 = {A standardized sampling technique for measuring plant diversity is needed to assist in resource inventories and for monitoring long-term trends in vascular plant species richness. The widely used â€˜Whittaker plotâ€™ (Shmida 1984) collects species richness data at multiple spatial scales, using 1 m2, 10 m2, and 100 m2 subplots within a 20 m Ã— 50 m (1000 m2) plot, but it has three distinct design flaws involving the shape and placement of subplots. We modified and tested a comparable sampling design (Modified-Whittaker plot) that minimizes the problems encountered in the original Whittaker design, while maintaining many of its attractive attributes. We overlaid the two sampling methods in forest and prairie vegetation types in Larimer County, Colorado, USA (n=13 sites) and Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA (n=19 sites) and showed that the modified design often returned significantly higher (p{$<$}0.05) species richness values in the 1 m2, 10 m2, and 100 m2 subplots. For all plots, except seven ecotone plots, there was a significant difference (p{$<$}0.001) between the Whittaker plot and the Modified-Whittaker plot when estimating the total number of species in the 1000 m2 plots based on linear regressions of the subplot data: the Whittaker plot method, on average, underestimated plant species richness by 34\%. Species-area relationships, using the Modified-Whittaker design, conformed better to published semilog relationships, explaining, on average, 92\% of the variation. Using the original Whittaker design, the semilog species-area relationships were not as strong, explaining only 83\% of the variation, on average. The Modified-Whittaker plot design may allow for better estimates of mean species cover, analysis of plant diversity patterns at multiple spatial scales, and trend analysis from monitoring a series of strategically-placed, long-term plots.},

The samples were processed using heavy liquid extraction and analyzed for siliceous plant microfossils (phytoliths). All samples yielded well preserved and diverse assemblages dominated by grass phytoliths, but included phytoliths produced by woody and herbaceous dicotyledons, palms, and sedges. The abundance of woody dicotyledons and palms decreased up section. The grass assemblages consisted mainly of Festucoid (C3) phytolith morphotypes. An index assessing the amount of tree cover (d:p, the ratio of dicotyledon phytoliths to grass phytoliths) was employed to interpret the data. According to this analysis, there was open C3-dominated grassland in the study area between 25 and 17 Ma, at least 7 Ma before supposed adaptations to grasslands in ungulates (hypsodonty) originate.},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Scenario planning helps managers incorporate climate change into their natural resource decision making through a structured â€œwhat-ifâ€� process of identifying key uncertainties and potential impacts and responses. Although qualitative scenarios, in which ecosystem responses to climate change are derived via expert opinion, often suffice for managers to begin addressing climate change in their planning, this approach may face limits in resolving the responses of complex systems to altered climate conditions. In addition, this approach may fall short of the scientific credibility managers often require to take actions that differ from current practice. Quantitative simulation modeling of ecosystem response to climate conditions and management actions can provide this credibility, but its utility is limited unless the modeling addresses the most impactful and management-relevant uncertainties and incorporates realistic management actions. We use a case study to compare and contrast management implications derived from qualitative scenario narratives and from scenarios supported by quantitative simulations. We then describe an analytical framework that refines the case studyâ€™s integrated approach in order to improve applicability of results to management decisions. The case study illustrates the value of an integrated approach for identifying counterintuitive system dynamics, refining understanding of complex relationships, clarifying the magnitude and timing of changes, identifying and checking the validity of assumptions about resource responses to climate, and refining management directions. Our proposed analytical framework retains qualitative scenario planning as a core element because its participatory approach builds understanding for both managers and scientists, lays the groundwork to focus quantitative simulations on key system dynamics, and clarifies the challenges that subsequent decision making must address.},

We assess the utility of the DI for monitoring more subtle disturbances using a weighting scheme that increases its sensitivity to specific disturbances. The weights were derived separately for each Landsat image in a dense time-series using linear discriminate analysis based on training data collected during a year of recovery after controlled prairie burns in the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas. The weights drew closer to zero as recovery progressed and the spectral differences between unburned and recovering sites diminished. The initial classification accuracy was very high, nearly 94\%, but the accuracy decreased as recovery advanced. By about 100 days after the initial fire, the classification accuracy was not statistically better than what might be achieved by chance. The results clearly highlight the value of statistically fitting the DI to specific disturbances and local conditions using derived weights.},

  Abstract                 = {Aminocyclopyrachlor (AMCP) will control many invasive broadleaf weeds, but the susceptibility of desirable forbs is not widely known. Native prairie response to AMCP was evaluated near Fargo, ND, and Felton, MN, in the Northern Great Plains. Both sites had high floristic quality prior to treatment, with 33 and 80 different species at Fargo and Felton, respectively. AMCP was applied at 140 g haâˆ’1 in July 2014 to coincide with leafy spurge and Canada thistle treatment timing. AMCP altered the plant communities and reduced foliar cover of undesirable species, high seral forbs (undisturbed stable communities), and low seral forbs (early succession in disturbed communities) at both locations at 10 and 14 mo after treatment (MAT). AMCP reduced Canada thistle and leafy spurge in Fargo and eliminated hedge bindweed, prickly lettuce, and black medic in Felton. High seral forb foliar cover was reduced at 10 and 14 MAT from 20\% to 2\% and 3\% in Fargo and from 19\% to 1.6\% and 2\% in Felton, respectively. The high seral forb species birdfoot violet, white panicled aster, northern bedstraw, Canada goldenrod, purple meadowrue, and American vetch were reduced at both locations. Low seral forb cover also decreased at 10 MAT from 22\% to 10\% in Fargo and from 12\% to 1\% in Felton, respectively. By 14 MAT, low seral species in Fargo recovered to 16\%, but recovery was much slower in Felton and slightly increased to 1.5\%. After treatment high and low seral monocot species increased at both sites, likely due to reduced competition from susceptible species. AMCP reduced richness, evenness, and diversity at both locations at 10 and 14 MAT; therefore, floristic quality declined. A decline in diversity is generally undesirable but could have beneficial effects if invasive weeds and other undesirable species are reduced or eliminated.},

  Abstract                 = {[ABSTRACT. Emerging insights from adaptive and community-based resource management suggest that building resilience into both human and ecological systems is an effective way to cope with environmental change characterized by future surprises or unknowable risks. We argue that these emerging insights have implications for policies and strategies for responding to climate change. We review perspectives on collective action for natural resource management to inform understanding of climate response capacity. We demonstrate the importance of social learning, specifically in relation to the acceptance of strategies that build social and ecological resilience. Societies and communities dependent on natural resources need to enhance their capacity to adapt to the impacts of future climate change, particularly when such impacts could lie outside their experienced coping range. This argument is illustrated by an example of present-day collective action for community-based coastal management in Trinidad and Tobago. The case demonstrates that community-based management enhances adaptive capacity in two ways: by building networks that are important for coping with extreme events and by retaining the resilience of the underpinning resources and ecological systems.]},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the effects of fire regime and bison activity on the plant communities of active bison wallows and the surrounding grazing lawns at Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeastern Kansas, USA. In both mid-June and late July the grazed sites had higher species richness and more vegetation cover than the wallow edges regardless of fire regime. The percent cover of most dominant perennial species was significantly higher on grazing lawns than in wallows. Annual species and exotic species had significantly higher cover in wallows than in grazing lawns and in annually burned sites compared to those burned at a 4-y interval. Overall, treatment effects on community structure and individual species abundance were stronger in the June. However, in July there was significantly more bare ground wallows around sites burned at a 4-y interval, suggesting increased wallowing activity at these sites. This finding suggests a strong effect of fire regime on seasonal bison activity, which further indicates the importance of multiple interacting disturbances for generating local- and landscape-level vegetation patterns in tall grass prairie.},

  Abstract                 = {Prescribed burning in Theodore Roosevelt National Park has played an important role in maintaining a natural ecosystem. However, changes in plant community dynamics caused by burning may have led to an invasion of weedy species such as Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense L.). The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of a fall burn before spring herbicide application on Canada thistle control and to evaluate the soil seedbank within Canada thistle infestations. Canada thistle stem densities initially were higher in the burned compared with the nonburned areas because plants were slower to emerge in the nonburned treatments. However, the effect was short-lived, and Canada thistle densities were similar in the burned and nonburned treatments by the second season following the prescribed burn. Canada thistle control averaged 78\% 60 days after treatment with clopyralid, clopyralid plus triclopyr, or picloram when spring applied whether or not application was preceded by a prescribed burn. Control declined to less than 60\% by 363 days after application. Grass cover increased from an average of 5\% before treatment to 37\% and 46\% 60 and 425 days after herbicide application, respectively, regardless of burn treatment. Forb cover increased following a prescribed burn but was unaffected by herbicide treatment. Overall the number and variety of species in the soil seedbank was not affected by a prescribed burn. A total of 74 species (56 forbs, 13 grasses, and 5 other mesic species) were found in the soil seedbank. However, the majority of the soil seedbank consisted of nondesirable low seral and invasive species including Canada thistle and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which accounted for over 80\% of the total germinated seed. Although a prescribed burn caused an initial increase in Canada thistle density and cover, the greater long-term concern may be the lack of desirable species present in the seedbank to replace Canada thistle once the weed is controlled.
Resumen
La quema prescrita en el Parque Nacional Theodore Roosevelt ha jugado un papel importante en mantener un ecosistema natural. Sin embargo, cambios en las dinÃ¡micas de la comunidad vegetal causadas por las quemas puede conducir a una invasiÃ³n de malezas, tal como el â€œCanada thistleâ€� (Cirsium arvense L.). Los objetivos de esta investigaciÃ³n fueron evaluar el efecto de la quema en otoÃ±o antes de la aplicaciÃ³n de herbicidas en primavera para del â€œCanada thistleâ€� y evaluar el banco de semillas del suelo en infestaciones del â€œCanada thistle.â€� Las densidades de tallos del â€œCanada thistleâ€� inicialmente fueron mayores en las Ã¡reas quemadas que en las no quemadas porque las plantas fueron lentas en emerger en los tratamientos no quemados. Sin embargo, el efecto fue corto, y para la segunda estaciÃ³n de crecimiento despuÃ©s de la quema prescrita las densidades de â€œCanada thistleâ€� fueron similares en los tratamientos quemados y no quemados. El control de â€œCanada thistleâ€� promedio 78\% 60 dÃ­as despuÃ©s de aplicar el tratamiento de clopiralid, clopiralid mas triclopir o picloram, esto cuando las aplicaciones fueron en primavera, sin importar si la aplicaciÃ³n fue precedida por fuego prescrito. 363 dÃ­as despuÃ©s de la aplicaciÃ³n el control diminuyÃ³ a menos del 60\%. La cobertura de gramÃ­neas se incrementÃ³ de 5\%, antes del tratamiento, a 37\% y 46\% 60 y 425 dÃ­as despuÃ©s de la aplicaciÃ³n del herbicida respectivamente, independientemente del tratamiento de quema. La cobertura de hierbas se incrementÃ³ despuÃ©s del tratamiento de quema prescrita, pero no fue afectado por el tratamiento de herbicidas. En general, el nÃºmero y variedad de especies en el banco de semillas del suelo no fue afectado por la quema prescrita. Un total de 74 especies (56 hierbas, 13 zacates y otras 5 especies mÃ©sicas) fueron encontradas en el banco de semillas del suelo. Pero, la mayorÃ­a del banco de semillas del suelo consistiÃ³ de especies no deseables de etapa seral baja y especies invasoras, incluyendo â€œCanada thistleâ€� y â€œKentucky bluegrassâ€� (Poa pratensis L.), las cuales aportaron mÃ¡s del 80\% del total de las semillas germinadas. Aunque un fuego prescrito causÃ³ un incremento inicial de la densidad y cobertura de â€œCanada thistleâ€�, la preocupaciÃ³n a largo plazo puede ser la falta de especies deseables presentes en el banco de semillas para remplazar el â€œCanada thistleâ€� una vez que la maleza ha sido controlada.},

  Abstract                 = {The fire history of the northern Great Plains has been largely reconstructed from the historical record. To clarify this history, segments of 1-m cores from four lakes in North and South Dakota and northeastern Montana were examined for charcoal fragments. The cores spanned a time interval of 172 to 380 yr. Samples integrating 5-10 yr of deposition were taken from 2-cm sections along each core and sieved. Charcoal concentrations ranged from 6-14,799 fragments/gram of sediment, and mean charcoal abundance was negatively correlated with longitude. Results suggest periods of increased fire from A.D. 1700-1740 and A.D. 1850-1900. These peaks were broadly synchronous across the region and ranged in duration from 20-40 yr. Postsettlement patterns of charcoal deposition were highly variable but generally much lower than presettlement intervals.},

It is generally agreed that many model processes are not accurately depicted by current remotely sensed indices of vegetation and that new observational capabilities are needed at different spatial and spectral scales to reduce uncertainty. Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research. In contrast to multispectral sensors, imaging spectroscopy produces quantitative estimates of biophysical absorptions, which can be used to improve scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and properties. We present the recent advances in imaging spectroscopy and new capabilities for using it to quantify a range of ecological variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Selective grazing of burned patches can be intense if animal distribution is not controlled and may compound the independent effects of fire and grazing on soil characteristics. Our objectives were to quantify the effects of patch burning and grazing on wind erosion, soil water content, and soil temperature in sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Torr.) mixed prairie. We selected 24, 4-ha plots near Woodward, OK. Four plots were burned during autumn (mid-November) and four during spring (mid-April), and four served as nonburned controls for each of two years. Cattle were given unrestricted access (Aprilâ€“September) to burned patches (Ï½2\% of pastures) and utilization was about 78\%. Wind erosion, soil water content, and soil temperature were measured monthly. Wind erosion varied by burn, year, and sampling height. Wind erosion was about 2 to 48 times greater on autumn-burned plots than nonburned plots during the dormant period (Decemberâ€“April). Growing-season (Aprilâ€“August) erosion was greatest during spring. Erosion of spring-burned sites was double that of nonburned sites both years. Growing-season erosion from autumn-burned sites was similar to nonburned sites except for one year with a dry Aprilâ€“May. Soil water content was unaffected by patch burn treatments. Soils of burned plots were 1 to 3Ø‡C warmer than those of nonburned plots, based on mid-day measurements. Lower water holding and deep percolation capacity of sandy soils probably moderated effects on soil water content and soil temperature. Despite poor growing conditions following fire and heavy selective grazing of burned patches, no blowouts or drifts were observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Restoration of historic fire regimes is complicated by concerns about exotic plant invasions, yet little is known of how the two may interact. Seeds of Japanese brome, spotted knapweed, Russian knapweed, and leafy spurge were subjected to fire at six fuel loads (100 to 700 g m22) and a nonburned control. Fires were simulated with field-cured grass and timeâ€“temperature profiles were developed from thermocouples at the soil surface. Emergence was determined by species and fuel load in growth chambers. Fuel load explained 98\% of variation in mean heat dosage and emergence decreased with increasing fuel load across species. Emergence was reduced 79 to 88\% relative to nonburned treatment with 100 g m22 of fuel and at least 97\% with 200 g m22 of fuel. Emergence probabilities were less than 0.01 for all species but spotted knapweed with a 300 g m22 fuel load. Results indicate high potential for fire to disrupt the life cycle of invasive species through direct seed mortality. The relationship between fuel load and seedling emergence provides good predictability of fire effects on surface-deposited seeds. A single fire is unlikely to eradicate many invasive species because they often produce abundant seeds and some will undoubtedly escape fire. However, abrupt reductions in seedling emergence with relatively light fuel loads indicate that fire may be an effective tool for increasing mortality of invasive plant seed across a broad range of habitats.

  Abstract                 = {Most wildï¬�res occur during summer in the northern hemisphere, the area burned annually is increasing, and ï¬�re effects during this season are least understood. Understanding plant response to grazing following summer ï¬�re is required to reduce ecological and ï¬�nancial risks associated with wildï¬�re. Forty 0.75-ha plots were assigned to summer ï¬�re then 0, 17, 34 or 50\% biomass removal by grazing the following growing season, or no ï¬�re and no grazing. Root, litter, and aboveground biomass were measured before ï¬�re, immediately after grazing, and 1 yr after grazing with the experiment repeated during 2 yr to evaluate weather effects. Fire years were followed by the second driest and ï¬�fth wettest springs in 70 yr. Biomass was more responsive to weather than ï¬�re and grazing, with a 452\% increase from a dry to wet year and 31\% reduction from a wet to average spring. Fire reduced litter 53\% and had no ï¬�rst-year effect on productivity for any biomass component. Grazing after ï¬�re reduced postgrazing grass biomass along the prescribed utilization gradient. Fire and grazing had no effect on total aboveground productivity the year after grazing compared to nonburned, nongrazed sites (1 327 vs. 1 249 6 65 kg Ã� haÃ€1). Fire and grazing increased grass productivity 16\%, particularly for Pascopyrum smithii. The combined disturbances reduced forbs (51\%), annual grasses (49\%), and litter (46\%). Results indicate grazing with up to 50\% biomass removal the ï¬�rst growing season after summer ï¬�re was not detrimental to productivity of semiarid rangeland plant communities. Livestock exclusion the year after summer ï¬�re did not increase productivity or shift species composition compared to grazed sites. Reduction of previous yearsâ€™ standing dead material was the only indication that ï¬�re may temporarily reduce forage availability. The consistent responses among dry, wet, and near-average years suggest plant response is species-speciï¬�c rather than climatically controlled.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire plays a central role in inï¬‚uencing ecosystem patterns and processes. However, documentation of ï¬�re seasonality and plant community response is limited in semiarid grasslands. We evaluated aboveground biomass, cover, and frequency response to summer, fall, and spring ï¬�res and no ï¬�re on silty and clayey sites in semiarid, C3-dominated grassland. The magnitude of change in biomass between years was greater than any differences among ï¬�re treatments. Still, differences existed among seasons of ï¬�re. Summer ï¬�re reduced non-native annual forb frequency (3\% vs. 10\% Â± 2\%) and Hesperostipa comata, reduced native annual forbs the ï¬�rst year, increased Poa secunda and bare ground, and increased Vulpia octoï¬‚ora the second year. Fall ï¬�re increased grass biomass (1224 vs. 1058 Â± 56 kgâˆ™haâˆ’1), but fall ï¬�re effects were generally similar to those of summer ï¬�re. Spring ï¬�re effects tended to be intermediate between no ï¬�re and summer and fall ï¬�re with the exception that spring ï¬�re was most detrimental to H. comata the ï¬�rst growing season and did not increase bare ground. All seasons of ï¬�re reduced litter, forb biomass, and frequency of Bromus japonicus and Artemisia spp., and they reduced H. comata, V. octoï¬‚ora, and native annual forbs the ï¬�rst year, but increased basal cover of C3 perennial grasses (2.2\% vs. 0.6\% Â± 0.4\%). Fire during any season increased dominance of native species compared with no ï¬�re (6.6\% vs. 2.0\% Â± 1.0\% basal cover) and maintained productivity. Seasonal timing of ï¬�re manipulated species composition, but increased C3 perennial grass cover and native species dominance with ï¬�re during any season indicated that using ï¬�re was more important than the season in which it occurred. In addition, ï¬�re effects on the vegetation components tended to be counter to previously observed effects of grazing, suggesting ï¬�re and grazing may be complementary.},

Diversity was greater in pastures than exclosures (Hâ€™ = 1.5400 vs. 1.3823 Â± 0.0431). Every biomass, cover, and diversity measure, except subshrub biomass, was affected by ï¬�re, grazing utilization, or both. Contrary to expectations, grazing history only interacted with ï¬�re effects for old standing dead material and interactions with grazing utilization were limited to old dead, bare ground, richness and dominance. Fire by grazing utilization interaction was limited to bare ground. Fire reduced annual grass (64 vs. 137 Â± 29 kg â‹… ha-1), forbs (84 vs. 133 Â± 29 kg â‹… ha-1), and diversity (Hâ€™ = 1.3260 vs. 1.5005 Â± 0.0537) with no difference in total current-year biomass (1 557 vs. 1 594 Â± 66 kg â‹… ha-1). Grazing to 75\% utilization reduced total current-year biomass (1 467 vs. 1 656 Â± 66 kg â‹… ha-1) and dominance (0.4824 vs. 0.5584 Â± 0.0279). Grazing history affected starting points for most variables, but changes caused by grazing utilization or ï¬�re were similar between pastures and exclosures, indicating management decisions can be made based on independent knowledge of grazing or ï¬�re effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Even as the division between professional scientists and laypeople became sharper by the end of the nineteenth century, the collaboration of local people remained important in scientific fieldwork, especially in sciences such as vertebrate paleontology that required longâ€�term extractive access to research sites. In the North American West, the competition between museums and universities for the best fossil quarry sites involved negotiations with locals. The conflict over differing conceptions of the field site is vividly demonstrated through an examination of one site on the High Plains of western Nebraska in the early twentieth century. This case offers a rare opportunity to see not only how professionals regarded such sites but also how the resident ranching family, the Cooks, attempted to exercise leverage over the scientific fieldwork that took place there. While the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh became mired in protracted conflict with the Cooks over discovery claims and the ongoing control of the site, the University of Nebraska and the American Museum of New York developed more harmonious relations with the site's resident ranching family.},

It is hypothesized that grazing will exert significant influence on vegetative biomass and native species richness, and soil depth, moisture content, pH, nutrient levels (total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus), and organic matter content. To test this hypothesis, four sets of samples were gathered: 10 from an ungrazed portion of TPNP and 10 from a grazed portion, 10 from an ungrazed area of KPBS and 10 from a grazed area. Results indicate that grazing decreased vegetative biomass density, increased soil nutrient levels, and increased soil organic matter content. Mixed results were found on the effects of grazing on available soil moisture and soil pH. Soil moisture content was significantly higher in the ungrazed area of TPNP, but significantly higher in the grazed area at KPBS. Soil pH was significantly higher in the ungrazed area of TPNP but no significant differences were observed at KPBS. Grazing did not significantly influence soil depth or species richness, though differences in the taxa of species observed were evident as native grass species richness decreased in grazed areas and invasive species richness increased in grazed areas.},

influencing the strength of the relationship. A scaling-up approach from small-scale sUAS imagery to broad-scale, digital aerial imagery collected at 1,200 meters by a piloted aircraft was used to provide AGB model estimates across the entire 4,500 ha of the Preserve. Spectral reflectance
data measured by spectroradiometer were also used to identify three optimal regions of the spectrum that have the highest significant correlations with tallgrass AGB.},

  Abstract                 = {Complete rest or grazing deferment is a general recommendation to encourage vegetative recovery following fire in the western United States. However, effects of grazing deferments on animal performance have not been determined. Prescribed fires were individually applied to nine separate, 1.5-ha pastures each year (2006 and 2007) for a total of 18 pastures. Grazing was deferred until spring (16 May), early summer (19 June), or late summer (1 August) the growing season after fire. At the end of each deferment, a 70-d (2007) or 41-d (2008) grazing period was initiated. Stocking rates were consistent between treatments within year, but were adjusted between years to achieve the targeted residual biomass of approximately 300 kg ? ha21. Diet quality was assessed approximately every 15 d throughout each grazing period (three pastures ? period21) via collection of rumen extrusa throughout the 2-yr study. Ewe body weight was measured on and off-test for each grazing period. Diet extrusa samples for in vitro organic matter disappearance was less (P 5 0.03) for late summer than early summer grazing periods and equal to the spring period (62.9, 64.6, and 61.0 6 0.90\%, respectively for spring, early summer, and late summer grazing periods). In vitro neutral detergent fiber disappearance decreased (P 5 0.01) by 10.6 percentage units from early grazing to late grazing period in 2007, whereas no differences were observed in 2008. Ewe average daily gain did not differ between spring and early summer grazing periods and were greater (P 5 0.03) than the negligible body weight gains of the late summer grazing period. Total gain was 10.9 kg ? ha21 greater in 2008, and a quadratic response was measured for grazing period in 2007. Results indicate that deferment until early summer may be preferable so that stocking rates can be more accurately determined and animal performance is not diminished.},

  Abstract                 = {Rangeland fire effects on flora, fauna, soils, and water have been studied widely. Fire effects information is limited on rangeland developments such as fencing. Fencing is an integral part of rangeland infrastructure and receives much attention when there is a wildfire or even discussion about conducting prescribed fires. Due to known fence age and fire history, we conducted a study on the Oklahoma State University Research Range located near Stillwater, Oklahoma. Five randomly selected individual metal T posts were sampled from a common fence line of known age and fire treatment. The T posts ranged from 4 to 35 yr since fence construction, with fire activity of 0, 1, 3, or 12 prescribed fires and 0, 1, or 2 wildfire occurrences. Each T post was tested in situ at 40 cm, 80 cm, and 120 cm above ground level for hardness and paint adhesion as set forth by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standards for hot wrought metal fence posts. Our results found no differences in post hardness, with all posts tested being higher than the ASTM minimum standard of 83 Rockwell B Hardness Scale. We also found that paint adhesion between burned and unburned T posts did not vary, with age of post being the only significant predictor variable for adhesion. Overall, our results provide evidence that T posts exposed to numerous fires and fire types did not suffer negative effects. This shows that concerns about wildfire and prescribed fires in grasslands having negative effects on metal T posts are unfounded.},

  Abstract                 = {Burning research in the northern mixed prairie has focused on sites considered to be more productive, although prescribed burning is usually conducted on heterogeneous landscapes with many different sites. Understanding the impacts of fire on less productive sites is a critical component in planning the frequency of prescribed burning of natural areas. The effects of burning in either April or October were measured on a draughty, upland site in west central South Dakota. Spring burning reduced blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii) production for 1-2 growing seasons, depending ,on postburn precipitation. Threadleaf sedge (Carex filtfolia) productivity was increased by burning in April and October when precipitation was above average b\textasciitilde{}t was reduced when postburn precipitation was low. Needle-and-thread (Stipa comata) production was generally reduced for 2-3 years by burning in either April or October. Recovery of needle-and-thread, western wheatgrass, and threadleaf sedge on an upland site of below average productivity required 1-3 years longer compared to more productive sites.},

  Abstract                 = {The Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program is, in a sense, an experiment to transform the nature of science, and represents one of the most effective mechanisms for catalyzing comprehensive site-based research that is collaborative, multidisciplinary, and long-term in nature. The scientific contributions of the Program are prodigious, but the broader impacts of participation have not been examined in a formal way. This book captures the consequences of participation in the Program on the perspectives, attitudes, and practices of environmental scientists. The edited volume comprises three sections. The first section includes two chapters that provide an overview of the history, goals, mission, and inner workings of the LTER network of sites. The second section comprises three dozen retrospective essays by scientists, data managers or educators who represent a broad spectrum of LTER sites from deserts to tropical forests and from arctic to marine ecosystems. Each essay addresses the same series of probing questions to uncover the extent to which participation has affected the ways that scientists conduct research, educate students, or provide outreach to the public. The final section encompasses 5 chapters, whose authors are biophysical scientists, historians, behavioral scientists, or social scientists. This section analyzes, integrates, or synthesizes the content of the previous chapters from multiple perspectives and uncovers emergent themes and future directions.},

The Northern Great Plains Network (NGPN) is among the 32 National Park Service Networks participating in this monitoring effort. The NGPN will develop protocols over the next several years to determine the overall health or condition of resources within 13 parks located in Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The NGPN identified water resources as a Vital Sign to monitor because water quality and quantity are important aspects of ecological processes that operate across multiple temporal and spatial scales. In the semi-arid region of the Northern Great Plains, surface-water resources within the NGPN are ecologically important. The 13 parks within the NGPN are diverse and vary greatly in size, visitation, and water resources. For example, the measured surface area of the Badlands National Park is about 243,000 acres, which represents nearly one-half of the combined acreage of all 13 NGPN park units; however, water resources within the park are scarce and the majority of streams are intermittent. The Badlands National Park annually hosts nearly 860,000 visitors. Mount Rushmore National Memorial also has limited water resources but hosts nearly 3 million visitors per year within its 1,278 acres. The Missouri National Recreational River contains the greatest portion of waterbodies within the NGPN, consisting of 139 rivers and streams within an areal extent of about 69,000 acres. Although water resources and acreage of the NGPN parks are varied, unifying factors among the parks include the relatively low population density within the Great Plains area and the strong emphasis on agrarian land use throughout the region. To address the diverse water quality concerns, NGPN received input from park staff and conducted pilot studies in 2009 and 2010. These factors, in combination with the NGPN budget allocations, resulted in development of the NGPNâ€™s water quality monitoring protocol. This protocol will provide a context to aid park resource managers in their day-to-day decisions and allow the assessment of the status (current conditions) and trends (directional changes across time) of streams/rivers within selected NGPN parks. Data collected from integrating water resource monitoring, in combination with the inventory of additional Vital Signs, can be used to assess resources and to aid in sound managerial decisions by the NGPN parks.

  Abstract                 = {Ecological interactions between fire and grazing have shaped the evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. Currently, grassland birds have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in rangelands managed with intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites. In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers. Widespread implementation of patch-burn grazing could result in significant improvements in habitat quality for wildlife in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The objectives of our research were to examine commonness?rarity patterns in fish communities in networks of intermittent streams. We quantified species abundance distributions and the importance of nestedness and turnover to community dissimilarity and then related commonness to colonisation, extinction and physiological tolerance. Patterns and relationships were evaluated spatially among sites and temporally within sites during non?drought and drought periods in tallgrass prairie streams of eastern Kansas, U.S.A. Supra?seasonal drought during 2011?2013 resulted in complete or partial drying of some sites and provided an opportunity to evaluate whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction. Abundance was used to predict re?colonisation in desiccated reaches and persistence in drying pools. Few species were common, while most were rare regardless of drought, and nestedness drove community dissimilarity across sites. Common species had higher colonisation and lower extinction than rarer species, but physiological tolerance was unrelated to commonness. Abundant species were generally the first to re?colonise desiccated reaches, but pre?drought abundance did not predict persistence in partially desiccated reaches. Although common species were the first to colonise and the last to go extinct, we were unable to determine whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction. Regardless, our study demonstrates linkages among commonness, colonisation and extinction.},

  Abstract                 = {Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) is an invasive, non-native plant in many terrestrial systems, often dominating plant communities, particularly in agricultural systems. Its invasion into forest systems is not well understood. Our objectives were to investigate the establishment, persistence, and abundance of C. arvense over a 7-year period following wildfire in a forest system, and to understand environmental factors related to variability in plant community composition. In 2006, we resurveyed 30 sites in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.) stands that burned during 1988 in Yellowstone National Park, and that had been previously sampled in 1999. C. arvense disappeared from six of nine sites where it was present in 1999, persisting in the remaining three sites; it also established at 4 new sites since 1999. Notably, the relative cover of C. arvense and other non-native plant species decreased during the 7-year period. Important ecosystem measures (plant species diversity and richness, aboveground net primary productivity, and leaf area index) were all higher in sites where C. arvense was present, and its abundance was higher on more fertile substrates and at lower elevations. Plant community composition was strongly influenced by gradients of soil texture and bare ground, rather than the presence or absence of non-native plant species. This project demonstrates the dynamic nature of an invasive species 18~years following a major disturbance, and suggests that intensive management of this species in forested systems is probably unnecessary.},

Across the WCB, we found a net decline in grass-dominated land cover totaling nearly 530,000 ha. With respect to agronomic attributes of lands undergoing grassland conversion, corn/soy production is expanding onto marginal lands characterized by high erosion risk and vulnerability to drought. Grassland conversion is also concentrated in close proximity to wetlands, posing a threat to waterfowl breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region. Longer-term land cover trends from North Dakota and Iowa indicate that recent grassland conversion represents a persistent shift in land use rather than short-term variability in crop rotation patterns. Our results show that the WCB is rapidly moving down a pathway of increased corn and soybean cultivation. As a result, the window of opportunity for realizing the benefits of a biofuel industry based on perennial bioenergy crops, rather than corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, may be closing in the WCB.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Identifying relationships between habitat selection and population processes is important for habitat management and wildlife conservation. For prairie?obligate species, space use and demography in extant grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland management practices associated with livestock production. Greater prairie?chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch?burn grazing is a rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on habitat use or survival of greater prairie?chickens are unknown. We used 3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland management on female greater prairie?chickens in the central Flint Hills during 2011?2013: Kaplan?Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen?Gill models to explore the links between habitat selection and cause?specific mortality risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch?burn grazing had annual survival rates (0.61?Â±?0.07?SE) that were 35\% higher than females on properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle stocking (0.45?Â±?0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that selected habitats created by patch?burn grazing experienced lower overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch?burn grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of greater prairie?chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Our results join a growing body of evidence that patch?burn grazing can provide higher quality grassland habitats for native wildlife species than current rangeland management associated with intensive cattle production. ? 2017 The Wildlife Society},

  Abstract                 = {Habitat relationships were examined for elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and bison (Bison bison) in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota. Elk and mule deer generally used range sites dominated by warm-season grasses (shallow and stony hills), whereas pronghorn and bison mainly used sites dominated by cool-season grasses (silty, clayey, and overflow). Elk used woodland sites moderately throughout the year. Pronghorn made greater use of stony hills sites in autumn and winter and the greatest use of prairie dog (Cynomys udovicianus) towns of all four ungulates. Mule deer use of overflow sites increased in autumn. Ungulates were broadly distributed over the park, except mule deer whose spatial distribution was limited. The combination of habitat overlap and spatial overlap indicates low potential for competition between all species except bison and pronghorn; differences in food habits probably reduces potential competition between these two species.},

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of transformer plant species, defined as harmful species that substantially modify ecosystems, was generally localized in Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas (TPNP). Surveys for transformer species were conducted along line transects (n=301) in September 2006. Nine of 16 transformer plant species (81.8\%) revealed significant positive associations with riparian forests or with cultivated land. These preferences are likely confounded in that the soils most suitable for cultivation lie in the vicinity of riparian forests. In contrast, a single transformer species revealed a significant positive association with roads. Agricultural areas and riparian forests appear to be more highly invaded than annually burned and grazed prairie in TPNP. Consequently, targeting early detection efforts in or near agricultural areas and riparian forests rather than the more extensive prairie will likely yield higher detection rates of transformer species.},
